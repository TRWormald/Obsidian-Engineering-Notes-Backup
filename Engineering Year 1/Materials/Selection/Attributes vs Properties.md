The **attributes** are the values that describe the state of a system, for example:
- Geometric (length, thickness, radius)
- Mechanical (force, torque)
- Subjective (tactile, easy to make)
- Financial (capital outlay, long-term costs)
The **material properties** are specific to a given material no matter its form, for example:
- Resistivity but not resistance
- Density but not mass
- Strength but not load carrying capacity
