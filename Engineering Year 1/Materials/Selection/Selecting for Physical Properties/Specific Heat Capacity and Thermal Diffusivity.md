#### Specific Heat Capacity and Thermal Diffusivity
We already know about [[Specific Heat Capacity at Constant Volume]] and [[Specific Heat Capacity at Constant Pressure]], however thermal diffusivity is a measure of how quickly a material changes temperature. A material with a low thermal diffusivity will change its temperature more slowly and a heat wave will take longer to pass through.
Diffusivity (a) can be calculated to be:
$$a = \frac{\lambda}{\rho C_p}$$
So it is related to the thermal conductivity of the material as well as its density and [[Specific Heat Capacity at Constant Pressure]].
\
Note that $\rho C_p$ is the energy absorbed by the wall per unit volume per degree.
