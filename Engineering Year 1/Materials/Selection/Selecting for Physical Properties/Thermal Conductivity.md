#### Thermal Conductivity
Thermal conductivity is a measure of how quickly the material can move heat from areas of high temperature to low temperature. We measure this my measuring the heat flux $q$ through a surface required to maintain a temperature gradient between a hot side and a cold side over a plate of material of thickness x, resulting in the equation:
$$\begin{align*}
q&= -\lambda \frac{\Delta T}{x}\\
&= \lambda \frac{{T_{1}-T_{2}}}{x}
\end{align*}$$

Where $\lambda$ is the thermal conductivity.
