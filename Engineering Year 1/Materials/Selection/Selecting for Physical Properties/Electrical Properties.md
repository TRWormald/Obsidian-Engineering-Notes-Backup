### Electrical Properties
The resistivity $\rho$ of a material is the dimension normalised resistance of a material (i.e. it is a material property). The higher a resistivity the more power lost across that material if in a circuit.
Metals are typically good conductors and as such have low resistivities.
Note that precipitate strengthening/alloying can increase the resistivity of a material as the alloying elements get in the way of electrons. 
The best option for strengthening a material that needs to carry both current and load (like overhead power lines) is work hardening as dislocations have a very low impact on electron movements.
