#### Thermal Expansion Coefficient
Thermal expansion is a strain arising from the increased separation of atoms as temperature increases. The expansion is resisted by stiffness of the atomic bonds and a good approximation is:
$$\alpha=\frac{1}{L}\frac{dL}{dT}(K^{-1})$$
Where $L$ is some linear dimension of a body.

If a material heats up then stresses can accumulate if expansion is constrained in some way, there are two common ways for this to happen:
1) Difference in expansion between two materials
If a structure is made up of two different materials that expand differently as temperature changes then stress can be created, take for example a small component with modulus $E_1$ and expansion coefficient $\alpha_1$ connected to a much larger one with expansion coefficient $\alpha_2$, the stress will be:
$$\sigma=E_1(\alpha_1-\alpha_2)\Delta T$$
So minimising differential stresses relies on choosing materials with similar expansion coefficients.
1) Thermal gradients
If heat is suddenly applied then a heat wave will move through the material and there will be a thermal strain/stress mismatch over that gradient (as some parts are expanding more than others).The stress is more extreme the greater the thermal gradient. Materials with high conductivity and low expansion coefficients reduce this strain. Typically materials with a high $\lambda/\alpha$ is predictive of better performance.
