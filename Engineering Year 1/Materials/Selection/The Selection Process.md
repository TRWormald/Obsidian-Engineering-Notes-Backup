The process for selecting materials typically goes as follows:

\
Where you start with a large number of materials and slowly increase the number of constraints you have until only a few options remain.
\
The first stage of this process is generating a **translation table** containing all of the information that will be required for the selection process, below is an exemplar:

### The Next Steps
After constructing the translation table we will need to consider the objective equation and the other supporting constraint equations.
**We rearrange the constraint equations and substitute them into the objective.

**Note you cannot rearrange and substitute in for a fixed variable - only free variables!**
Then we find the Material Index by removing all but the material properties in the constraint equation.
