>*Strength is the critical value of stress above which the material fails*

However 'failure' is ambiguous and can be different for the different types of materials that we are testing.
Hence strength is defined by how we define failure:
### For Ductile Materials
There are three main types of strength:
1) Tensile Strength - the maximum strength from tensile stress before failure.
2) Yield Strength - Stress at which plastic strain begins
3) 0.2% Proof Strength - Stress required to produce a permanent 0.2% strain deformation.
### For Brittle Materials
These materials also have tensile strength, but have a different compressive strength which is often much higher (e.g. concrete is much stronger in compression than in tension)
