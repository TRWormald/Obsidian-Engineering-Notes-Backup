Resilient materials can absorb lots of impact energy. When materials are distorted by a stress they contain elastic strain energy - the work done to the material is stored and is returnable if the material is elastic.
\
If we assume all work is stored:
$$\begin{align*}
dW&= \frac{F}{A}\times \frac{dL}{L}\\
&= \sigma\cdot d\varepsilon\\
\\
W&=\int_{0}^{\sigma^{*}}\sigma\cdot d\varepsilon\\
&=  \int_{0}^{\sigma^{*}}\frac{\sigma}{E}\cdot d\sigma\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\frac{(\sigma^{*})^{2}}{E}
\end{align*}$$
Hence:
$$\text{Resilience}=W=\frac{1}{2}\frac{(\sigma^{*})^2}{E}$$
Where $\sigma^{*}$ is the upper limit on stress and is different for brittle and ductile materials:
- For **Brittle Materials** it is the **Elastic Limit** $\sigma_{el}$
- For **Ductile Materials** it is the **Yield Strength** $\sigma_{y}$
