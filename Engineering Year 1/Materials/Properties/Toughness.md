>*Toughness is the amount of work done to make a material break - it is a measure of energy absorbed.*

It is calculated using:
$$\text{Toughness}=W=\int_{0}^{\varepsilon_{f}}\sigma\cdot d\varepsilon$$
Where $\varepsilon_{f}$ is the strain to failure. 
In other words the toughness is the total area under the stress strain curve - from zero strain to strain to failure:

We can use a rough rule of thumb:
$$W\approx\frac{\sigma_{y}+\sigma_{ts}}{2}\cdot \varepsilon_{f}$$
Where $\sigma_y$ is the yield strength and $\sigma_{ts}$ is the tensile strength.
