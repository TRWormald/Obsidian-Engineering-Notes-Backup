> *Ductility is the strain to failure in a tensile test (usually as a percentage)*

Hence:
$$\text{Ductility}=\varepsilon_{f}\times100\%$$
Where $\varepsilon_f$ is the strain to failure.
This allows us to reformulate the equation as:
$$\begin{align*}
\text{Ductility}&= \frac{L_f-L_0}{L_{0}}\times100\%\\
&\approx \frac{A_{0}-A_{f}}{A_{0}}\times100\%
\end{align*}$$
\
High ductility is often associated with safety as deformation will occur before fracture/failure.
A material with a ductility greater than 5% is considered **Ductile**, and less and it is considered **Brittle**.
