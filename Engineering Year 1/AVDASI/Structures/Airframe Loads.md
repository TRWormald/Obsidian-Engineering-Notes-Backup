### Major Loads on Aircraft Structures

#### Aerodynamic and Inertia Loads
Aerodynamic forces reacted to by inertia provide the basic loading on aircraft structures.
For example the lift opposing the weight of the aircraft - in cruise the aircraft experiences a load equal to its weight.
The centre of gravity also needs to be considered, it is typically located forward of the centre of pressure - and consequentially a small downwards tail load is required to maintain moment equilibrium.
Gusts and Manoeuvres create the highest loads (but only for short periods of time)
We also consider the loads on the plane during emergency circumstances and they are frequently a key design driver - as this increases the safety of the aircraft.

Different aircraft are designed with different levels of intended flight loads:

| Aircraft Type | Typical 'g' value |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Transport     | +2.5              |
| Light         | +4.5              |
| Aerobatic     | +8.0 to -6.0      |
| Fighter       | +9.0 to -3.5      |
#### Cabin Pressurisation Loads
The interior of the cabin will have a different pressure to the atmosphere outside - if the aircraft is flying at a high altitude.
The cabin must therefore be able to withstand this pressure differential - however obviously the maximum load is only 1atm (100,000Pa).
The more major concern with regards to cabin pressurisation loads is that of cyclic fatigue - that is the cabin being pressurised and unpressurised repeatedly leading to deformation.
#### Landing Loads
Landing the aircraft produces high overall loading on the whole structure, as well as local loading in the undercarriage and attachment.
This is another source of fatigue loading - this is related to the number of flights but not the number of flight hours (as the load only occurs during landing).
#### Engine Loads
Engines produce, in addition to thrust forces, large inertia loads due to their weight. There are also secondary loadings due to torque and gyroscopic effects.
Large commercial aircraft have a specific airworthiness requirement - they have to be able to cope with a 'sustained engine imbalance' in flight - i.e. an engine failure.
#### Thermally Induced Loads
Thermal expansion can cause large forces where thereare temperature gradients (i.e. the leading edge of a supersonic aircraft) or where different materials join together (due to the difference in their thermal expansion coefficients).
The temperature envelope for a long range commercial aircraft is from around 50 centigrade on the ground to -56 centigrade at cruise altitude.
#### Impact/Crash Loads
The structure must be able to withstand impacts - for example a bird strike or an uncontained engine turbine failure.
Passenger safety is also a key priority - seats must remain attached, the rupture of fuel tanks should be prevented, and no detrimental deformation on cabin doors or door frames.
