### Major Loads on Aircraft Structures

#### Aerodynamic and Inertia Loads
Aerodynamic forces reacted to by inertia provide the basic loading on aircraft structures.
For example the lift opposing the weight of the aircraft - in cruise the aircraft experiences a load equal to its weight.
The centre of gravity also needs to be considered, it is typically located forward of the centre of pressure - and consequentially a small downwards tail load is required to maintain moment equilibrium.
Gusts and Manoeuvres create the highest loads (but only for short periods of time)
We also consider the loads on the plane during emergency circumstances and they are frequently a key design driver - as this increases the safety of the aircraft.

Different aircraft are designed with different levels of intended flight loads:

| Aircraft Type | Typical 'g' value |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Transport     | +2.5              |
| Light         | +4.5              |
| Aerobatic     | +8.0 to -6.0      |
| Fighter       | +9.0 to -3.5      |
#### Cabin Pressurisation Loads
The interior of the cabin will have a different pressure to the atmosphere outside - if the aircraft is flying at a high altitude.
The cabin must therefore be able to withstand this pressure differential - however obviously the maximum load is only 1atm (100,000Pa).
