### Basic Airframe Structural Requirements
#### Strength
The structure must carry limit loads (these are the maximum loads anticipated during survice) without damage.
The structure must carry ultimate loads (normally 1.5 x limit loads) without failure.
There must be no detrimental permanent deformation under Limit Load (i.e. elastic deformation = ok, plastic deformation = bad).
#### Stiffness
Deflections must not be excessive (e.g. the wings must retain its cross section)
Buckling is also controlled by stiffness
Flight controls must physically function at a typical factor of 1.15 times the Limit Load
Stiffness is also related to Aeroelasticity
#### Low Weight
The structure of a passenger aircraft is typically around 30% of the all-up weight, whereas the payload may only be 15%, so small increases in weight can significantly affect performance.
Fundamentally you have to strike the correct balance between structural soundness and weight considerations.
#### Resistance to Fatigue
Fatigue is failure due to repeated application of a load which is not large enough to cause failure when applied statically.
Fatigue damage initiates at stress concentrations, and can be reduced by good design.
#### Resistance to Corrosion
Aircraft structures are normally painted to provide protection. 
Surface treatments such as anodising aluminium are also important.
Galvanic protection is required on carbon to aluminium interfaces.
Environmental concerns are a priority when selecting a protective treatment.
#### Damage Tolerance
The aircraft must be able to operate safely in the presence of manufacturing defects or damage arising durign service.
Structure must be able to withstand large damage for economic repair. This is not an airworthiness requirement but is a pragmatic commercial requirement.
### Structures Fatigue and Damage Tolerance
**Fatigue** is defined as:
*The progressive weakening of a material caused by repeated and fluctuating loads which never reach a level sufficient to cause failure in a single application.*

There are several different design philosophies that deal with fatigue:
