### Basic Airframe Structural Requirements
#### Strength
The structure must carry limit loads (these are the maximum loads anticipated during survice) without damage.
The structure must carry ultimate loads (normally 1.5 x limit loads) without failure.
There must be no detrimental permanent deformation under Limit Load (i.e. elastic deformation = ok, plastic deformation = bad).
#### Stiffness
Deflections must not be excessive (e.g. the wings must retain its cross section)
Buckling is also controlled by stiffness
Flight controls must physically function at a typical factor of 1.15 times the Limit Load
Stiffness is also related to Aeroelasticity
#### Low Weight
The structure of a passenger aircraft is typically around 30% of the all-up weight, whereas the payload may only be 15%, so small increases in weight can significantly affect performance.
Fundamentally you have to strike the correct balance between structural soundness and weight considerations.
