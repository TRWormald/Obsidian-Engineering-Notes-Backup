### Basic Airframe Structural Requirements
#### Strength
The structure must carry limit loads (these are the maximum loads anticipated during survice) without damage.
The structure must carry ultimate loads (normally 1.5 x limit loads) without failure.
There must be no detrimental permanent deforemation under Limit Load.
