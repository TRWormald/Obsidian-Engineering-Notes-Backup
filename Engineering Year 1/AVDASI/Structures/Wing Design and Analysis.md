### Basic Wing Structures
What does a wing need to do?
- A beam that can carry bending
- A beam that can carry vertical shear
- A section that can carry a torsional load
i.e. A basic resistance to SMT (Shear, Moment & Torque)

Following is a diagram of the typical **Commercial Wing Torsion Box Layout**:

Note how the upper and lower skin (cover) is reenforced by horizontal stringers.
There are also spanwise spar elements which define (along with the top and bottom covers) the primary torsion box - **which is the primary load carrying structure of the wing**.
In larger wings, closer to the root, there is often a centre spar as it is more efficient to have an additional structure than to try to carry the entire load with only two spars (by making them thicker).
