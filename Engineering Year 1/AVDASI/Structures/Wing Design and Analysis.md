### Basic Wing Structures
What does a wing need to do?
- A beam that can carry bending
- A beam that can carry vertical shear
- A section that can carry a torsional load
i.e. A basic resistance to SMT (Shear, Moment & Torque)

Note how the upper and lower skin (cover) is reenforced by horizontal stringers.
There are also spanwise spar elements which define (along with the top and bottom covers) the primary torsion box - **which is the primary load carrying structure of the wing**.
In larger wings, closer to the root, there is often a centre spar as it is more efficient to have an additional structure than to try to carry the entire load with only two spars (by making them thicker).
There are also wing-box rubs which run from the front spar to the rear spar which separate the skin-stringer combination into reasonable lengths for buckling.

The multiple spars are used to increase the ability of the plane to resist damage. This is because multiple torsion boxes are present created and some are redundant. This is not particularly effective in Civil Aircraft as it unnecessarily increases the weight - however for Military Aircraft it can make sense.
### Wing Design Considerations
When designing a wing you need to take several things into consideration:
- The leading and trailing edges are often not considered part of the main wing-box structure, and are just required to transfer loads chordwise into the box, rather than spanwise along the wing.
- The leading edge may contribute significantly to overall torsional stiffness
- The leading and trailing efges also need to accomodate control and high lift devices
- A single spar may be able to carry loads adequately on a small aircraft. An I section spar will be poor in torsion, nad the closed section formed by the skin will need to carry these loads.
- In a box formed by two spars the bending can be carried by the spars strengthened with an
