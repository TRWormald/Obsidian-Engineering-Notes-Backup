### Types of Loading
There are a few main ways that an aircraft can be loaded:
\
**Tensile Loads**
Tie bars and wire are very efficient ways of transmitting tensile loads, the latter however cannot transmit compression loads, whilst the former can - however they do have the advantage that the failure of a single strand doesn't result in the complete failure of the cable.
The main issues with structures loaded in tension are fracture and fatigue. Some high strength materials are very brittle which makes them undesirable for tension members if there is a risk of sudden catastrophic failure.
\
**Compression**
Stiffness is critical in compression members because of the risk of buckling. This depends on the material stiffness (see [[Buckling of Columns and Struts]]) and the structural stiffness related to shape (see the [[Second Moment of Area]])
The ideal member is a thin walled tube as it maximises the second moment of area for a given amount of material. However, if the ratio of radius to wall thickness is too large there is a risk of local wall buckling.
Fatigue is much less of a concern as cracks do not usually propagate under compression.
\
**Shear**
Shear involves a change in angle or shape - complementary shear forces are required to produce shear.
Simple shear causes bending - not pure shear
Shear can be carried by tensile and compressive members at 45 degrees. Panels are good at carrying shear by resisting shape change.
\
**Bending**
Bending can be carried by tensile and compressive members separated in space. An I beam approximates this, and is efficient for resisting bending. The web separates the flanges, and helps prevent bucking of the compression flange.
\
**Bending With Shear**
The web of an I-beam carries the shear that is not present in pure bending. A warren truss is an efficient arrangement for carrying bending within shear. Compression members need to be larger section than tension members to resist bucking. Ties can carry tension loads. But if the direction of loading reverses, all members need to be able to resist both tension and compression.
