### Types of Loading
There are a few main ways that an aircraft can be loaded:
\
**Tensile Loads**
Tie bars and wire are very efficient ways of transmitting tensile loads, the latter however cannot transmit compression loads, whilst the former can - however they do have the advantage that the failure of a single strand doesn't result in the complete failure of the cable.
The main issues with structures loaded in tension are fracture and fatigue. Some high strength materials are very brittle which makes them undesirable for tension members if there is a risk of sudden catastrophic failure.
\
**Compression**
Stiffness is critical in compression members because of the risk of buckling. This depends on the material stiffness (see [[Buckling of Columns and Struts]]) and the structural stiffness related to shape (see the [[Second Moment of Area]])
The ideal member is a thin walled tube as it maximises the second moment of area for a given amount of material. However, if the ratio of radius to wall thickness is too large there is a risk of local wall buckling.
Fatigue is much less of a concern as cracks do not usually propagate under compression.
\
**Shear**
Shear involves a change in angle or shape - complementary shear forces are required to produce shear.
Simple shear causes bending - not pure shear
Shear can be carried by tensile and compressive members at 45 degrees. Panels are good at carrying shear by resisting shape change.
\
**Bending**
Bending can be carried by tensile and compressive members separated in space. An I beam approximates this, and is efficient for resisting bending. The web separates the flanges, and helps prevent bucking of the compression flange.
\
**Bending With Shear**
The web of an I-beam carries the shear that is not present in pure bending. A warren truss is an efficient arrangement for carrying bending within shear. Compression members need to be larger section than tension members to resist bucking. Ties can carry tension loads. But if the direction of loading reverses, all members need to be able to resist both tension and compression.
Diagonal cross-bracing can be used if both directions of loading need to be considered - two ties which only have to carry tension may be lighter than a single compression member.
\
**Torsion**
Torsion is a twisting moment acting about the axis of the structure. It is most effectively carried by shear forces around a closed structure. A box or tube within a continuous skin is very efficient. Alternatively the shear can be carried by cross braced members.
### Types of Airframe Construction
There are several different types of airframe types:
#### Frame with non-structural Covering
This can be seen in many early bi- and tri-planes:

In this configuration all loads are carried by the frame structure, with the skin assumed not to carry any load except air pressure. This could be used for early aircraft due to the fact that the aerodynamic loads were very low.
#### Monocoque
This is where there is a single skin with no supporting frame, so all loads have to be carried by the skin. True monocoque was problematic for large scale use due to problems with buckling.

Sandwich structures can be used without supporting members - this is where you have two layers of skin separated with a core material.
#### Stressed Skin
This is where you have a 'stressed' (loaded) skin supported by an internal frame. This is very much the classic arrangement for aircraft load carrying.
The load is divided by the skin and the stringers, with the stringers and frames (or ribs) dividing the skin into small panels to provide resistance to buckling.

#### Shear Resistant Structures
In this method stiffeners divide up panels to prevent buckling, however this can result in a heavy design in some cases.
It is important to consider the different circumstances of each case and to choose the correct loading type for each - as the same method that might work well for a high AR wing might not work as well for a low one.
#### Tension Field Structures
When the panels buckle in this configuration they carry diagonal tension only - the 'diagonal tension field'

Stiffeners carry compressive loads - this is generally more efficient for thin skin structures.
Effectively what is happening here is the panels are being allowed to buckle deliberately and they then act as a tensile connector effectively creating a pseudo-truss structure as they carry the required tensile loads to hold the structure in place.
### Functions of basic structural members in a stressed skin construction
#### Skin
The skin carries tensile loads as well as compressive loads - however the effectiveness depends on the level of stiffening.
It also carries shear loads associated with bending and torsion.
It also provides a smooth aerodynamic surface as well as a sealed enclosure.
#### Stringers
These are the stiffening members within the wing. They carry tensile and compressive loads; add stiffness to the skin to enable it to resist bucking and carry higher compressive stresses. They also provide bending stiffness to resist distortion of skin due to local loads and divide up the skin into small panels to reduce bucking due to shear and/or compression.
#### Frames and Ribs
Frames are normally associated with the fuselage structure whilst Ribs are normally associated with the wing or box structure.
They are used to:
- Support stringers against compressive buckling
- To divide the skin into panels to reduce shear buckling
- To distribute discrete loads into the rest of the structure
- To maintain cross-sectional shape
### Fuselage Structures Loading
#### Loading in Level Flight
For simple illustration lets assume:
- Uniform distribution of mass along the length
- Wings and tail loads act at single points
- Thrust and drag are ignored
This leads to:
