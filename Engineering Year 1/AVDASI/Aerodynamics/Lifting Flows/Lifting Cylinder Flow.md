The only mechanisms we have for transmitting forces (and hence lift) to a body is via pressure and shear stress on the body surface.
The potential flow over a rotating cylinder will give us some insight into how lift is generated.
We will form our model using the doublet and uniform flow from [[Flow over a Cylinder]] and add to it a [[Point Vortex Flow]] at the centre:

This results in:

The velocity conditions at the surface are now very interesting, if the fluid was truly inviscid the rotation of the body would not change the flow - however this is not the case here; the speed on the surface equals the inviscid speed plus the true viscous speed.
### Calculating the Velocities and the Pressure Coefficient
Previously we found that:
$$\begin{align*}
u&= 2U_{\infty}\sin^{2}\theta\\
v&=-2U_{\infty}\cos\theta\sin\theta 
\end{align*}$$
The velocities for vortex flow are:
$$\begin{align*}
u=\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi} y/x^{2} 
\end{align*}$$
