### Pneumatic Functions
 - For Engine Starting
 Many large turbine engines are started by an air-powered starter motor on the accessory gearbox which mechanically drives one of the engine shafts.
 Some systems also use a blast of air directly onto the turbine blades.
 Power comes from an engine already running or the APU. (APUs themselves can be started electrically from the aircraft battery, ground power, or from the main engines if they are operating)
 - Engine bleed air to power systems.
Hot air under pressure taken from one or more compressor stage. This can be used for wing de-icing - hot air ducted onto the leading edge, or for powering the air conditioning system. Some aircraft also have fully blown flaps (like the TSR-2) which increases lift when the aircraft is flying at high angles of attack.

#### Pneumatic Environmental Control System
The air conditioning system is pneumatically powered from bleed air, which provides cabin pressurisation and heat. Pressurised air bled from the compressor is first cooled in a heat exchanger by air passing through the fan casing. This helps with the wide range of temperatures of bleed air during the flight cycle (often multiple ports on the engine are used to provide different pressures and temperature at different throttle settings). An ‘air cycle machine’ (ACM) air conditioner (uses air as the refrigerant) then cools the air and removes moisture and filters. To provide the correct temperature of air to the cabin, warm bled air can be bypassed around the air conditioning unit and mixed with the cold air before being fed to the cabin.

Note that pneumatic systems reduce the performance of the engine as we are syphoning off air that would otherwise be used to produce thrust.
