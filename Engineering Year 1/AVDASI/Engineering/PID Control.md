PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Differential and it is a method of controlling a system (be it an aircraft, rocket, satellite, ship, and even things like ovens).
\
The final equation for a general PID system is:
\
$$u(t)=k_p~e(t) + k_i \int_0^t e(t')\cdot dt' + k_d~\frac{de}{dt}$$
\
Where:
$u(t)$ is the control input
$e(t)$ and $e(t')$ are the error or deviation
$k_p$ , $k_i$ , and $k_d$ are all constants for their respective components of the equation
#### Explanation
The PID system works by calculating an error or deviation which is a vector generated by subtracting where it is from where it wants to be.
\
This error is then applied as a control input:
\
$$u(t)=k_p~e(t)$$
\
Where:
$u(t)$ is the control input
$k_p$ is a constant 
$e(t)$ is the error or deviation
\
However this does not take into account the fact that it may not be possible to correct to the right bearing and as a result we must introduce the integral component of the equation:
\
$$u(t)=k_p~e(t) + k_i \int_0^t e(t')\cdot dt'$$
\
This component is working against steady state error, effectively keeping track of how much you need to alter your course due to the fact that you are only continuing on the path you were originally rather than being moved further off course.
\
However at the moment the equation does not take into account the fact that as you get closer to the desired heading and would result in oscillation. As a result we add the differential component of the equation:
\
$$u(t)=k_p~e(t) + k_i \int_0^t e(t')\cdot dt' + k_d~\frac{de}{dt}$$
\
This differential reduces the input if the error is decreasing very quickly, making oscillations less likely.
