Modern civil aircraft use electrical power for a wide variety of tasks and have a correspondingly higher demand. They feature multiple generators and system voltages, and are architected to provide redundancy in case of individual component failure. A typical system includes a 3 phase 115V AC system for high power loads and a back-up system based around a 28V DC supply.

In an AC system the polarity of both the current and the potential are bi-polar and time varying, normally sinusoidally. RMS (root mean square) quantities are used to simplify calculations. V and I are related by the impedance Z.
See [[AC Power]] for more information.

#### Single Phase vs Multi-Phase AC
In AC single phase we have a single live, neutral, and earth terminal.

Three Phase AC systems feature phase voltages displaced by $120\degree$. Most higher power systems are 3 phase AC.
