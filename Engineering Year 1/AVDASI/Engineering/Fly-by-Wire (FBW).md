FBW is a system of controlling an aircraft through electrical signals rather than the more antiquated mechanical control where all control authority was handled by the pilot through linkages to the various controls.
\
Hydraulic, Electrical or Electro-Hydraulic systems are controlled by the FBW system after taking inputs from the pilot. The FBW system allows for many different operating conditions to be taken into account - for example landing, take off, and cruise.
\
FBW systems have different modes, called 'Laws', which are activated based on the availability of information to the system.
#### Normal Law
Normal Law is the most protected mode of the FBW system, it is subdivided into flight phases (Ground, Flight, Flare).
\
Fore/Aft sidestick commands **Load Factor** (as opposed to elevator angle) which is effectively the rate of climb/descent of the aircraft (this is measured in g)
\
Left/Right sidestick commands **Roll Rate** (as opposed to aileron angle)
\
Rudder pedals command **Sideslip** (as opposed to rudder angle)
\
This allows turns to be automatically coordinated (so the rudder blends with ailerons automatically).
Trim is done automatically
The aircraft cannot be stalled and you cant overstress the aircraft/flaps
However you can still fly it into objects
#### Alternate Law
Alternate law is activated when there isn't sufficient information for Normal Law - as it is required to calculate/compute control deflections from pilot inputs.
This results in the aircraft no longer having stall protection (as the aircraft no longer knows whether it is about to stall - as it doesn't know its AoA or airspeed)
#### Direct Law
If even more information is lost **control surface angles become proportional to sidestick movement**. This effectively converts the FBW system into a traditional mechanical control system.
This can be dangerous as it is possible for the aircraft to be overstressed due to the lack of feedback.
#### Mechanical Law
This is the final mode which is switched on in the event of a total electrical failure.
The engines go to idle
Tailplane hydraulic trim can be manually controlled along with the rudder
\
It is expected that FBW/electrical functions will be recovered after Mechanical Law is entered and as such it is just a system to control the aircraft whilst waiting for this to happen.
