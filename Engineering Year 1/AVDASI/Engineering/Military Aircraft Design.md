### Energy Manoeuvrability Theory (Or Scam)
It draws a distinction between instantaneous manoeuvrability (IM) and sustained (continuous) manoeuvrability (SM), for the purposes of comparing aircraft.
#### Specific Energy
They compare specific energy, i.e. the mass independent sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the plane:
$$E_{sp}=\frac{v^2}{2g}+h=\frac{E}{mg}$$
This is a representation of the *advantage* that an aircraft begins with. It doesn't tell us anything about an aircrafts ability to continue to manoeuvre after the event has begun.
#### Specific Excess Power
Who can continue to manoeuvre once the event has begun?
$$P_{sp}=\frac{T-D}{W}V$$
Where $T$ is thrust $N$, $D$ is drag ($N$), ($W$) is the weight of the aircraft ($N$), and V is the speed of the aircraft ($ms^{-1}$).
We can compare the specific power contours produced and 'theoretically' if your contour is greater then you have a sustained manoeuvring advantage and hence you can win.
#### Wing Loading and Load Factor n
The wing loading factor can be calculated as:
$$n=\frac{C_{L_{max}}\frac{1}{2}\rho V^2}{\frac{W}{S}}$$
Small wing loading favours a high load factor or 'g'. In turn a high 'g' favours low turn radius and high turn rate.

**The problem with energy manoeuvrability theory is the fact that it presupposes that manoeuvrability is a desired characteristic. This is an outdated and outmoded doctrine especially since any missile will outrun and out turn you due to the fact that it doesn't have a squishy pilot who is likely to stroke out if they experience sustained loads of upwards of 7g.**
