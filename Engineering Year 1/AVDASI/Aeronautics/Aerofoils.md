This is the basic cross sectional shape of an aircraft wing.

And it is what generates the lift for the aircraft.
Below we can see a diagram showing a typical aerofoil's lift characteristics:

Note the fact that a cambered aerofoil produces lift at zero angle of attack, and that it is only at a negative AoA that zero lift is produced.
Note also how $C_{L_{max}}$ occurs at a high angle of attack and is quickly followed by stall as a result of flow separation.
Increasing the AoA linearly increases the coefficient of lift until just before $C_{L_{max}}$.
### What Causes Stall?
Stall occurs when the flow separates from the aerofoil, this is because the flow fundamentally wants to carry on travelling in the direction that it is going - and we are trying to force it to turn a corner - and at some point it eventually gives up:

This is bad as lots of turbulence is created after the separation point; increasing drag as well as the primary issue that the air is no longer being redirected downwards as much.
A sharper aerofoil/leading edge will result in earlier separation:

### Delaying Stall/Increasing $C_{L_{max}}$
There are several ways of delaying stall, primarily through increasing the [[Reynolds Number]] or increasing the thickness to chord ratio:

Increasing the Reynold's Number increases the $C_{L_{max}}$ because it results in a reduction in viscosity. This means that the boundary layer is thinner and therefore less prone to separation.
\
Another way to increase $C_{L_{max}}$ is by increasing the **Camber** of the aerofoil:

### High Lift Devices
#### Flaps
Flaps are important devices on an aircraft which increase camber and effective angle of attack, which results in increased lift.

#### Slats
Slats are used to increase the angle at which stall occurs, this can be seen in the diagram below:
![[Pasted image 20240429142514.png|center]]
We can see in **b** that the slat results in a later separation point due to the higher velocity air passing over the slat forcing the lower velocity air below it onto the aerofoil.
