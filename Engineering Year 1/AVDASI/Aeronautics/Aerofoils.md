This is the basic cross sectional shape of an aircraft wing.

And it is what generates the lift for the aircraft.
Below we can see a diagram showing a typical aerofoil's lift characteristics:

Note the fact that a cambered aerofoil produces lift at zero angle of attack, and that it is only at a negative AoA that zero lift is produced.
Note also how $C_{L_{max}}$ occurs at a high angle of attack and is quickly followed by stall as a result of flow separation.
Increasing the AoA linearly increases the coefficient of lift until just before $C_{L_{max}}$.
### What Causes Stall?
Stall occurs when the flow separates from the aerofoil, this is because the flow fundamentally wants to carry on travelling in the direction that it is going - and we are trying to force it to turn a corner - and at some point it eventually gives up:

This is bad as lots of turbulence is created after the separation point; increasing drag as well as the primary issue that the air is no longer being redirected downwards as much.
A sharper aerofoil/leading edge will result in earlier separation:

### Delaying Stall/Increasing $C_{L_{max}}$
There are several ways of delaying stall, primarily through increasing the [[Reynold's Number]] or increasing the thickness to chord ratio:
