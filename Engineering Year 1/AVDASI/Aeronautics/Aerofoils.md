This is the basic cross sectional shape of an aircraft wing.

And it is what generates the lift for the aircraft.
Below we can see a diagram showing a typical aerofoil's lift characteristics:

Note the fact that a cambered aerofoil produces lift at zero angle of attack, and that it is only at a negative AoA that zero lift is produced.
Note also how $C_{L_{max}}$ occurs at a high angle of attack and is quickly followed by stall as a result of flow separation.
Increasing the AoA linearly increases the coefficient of lift until just before $C_{L_{max}}$.
### What Causes Stall?
Stall occurs when the flow separates from the aerofoil, this is because the flow fundamentally wants to carry on t
