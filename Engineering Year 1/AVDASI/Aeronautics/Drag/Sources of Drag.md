### Drag Breakdown
There are two underlying sources of drag:
1) **Skin friction drag**
	- Sometimes called **surface friction drag**
	- It is the streamwise component of the tangential stresses acting at the surface
	- It is a direct result of the fluid viscosity
2) **Pressure Drag**
	- The streamwise component of pressure forces acting **normal** to the surface
	- It consists of:
	a) **Form Drag** due to **Boundary Layer** growth
	b) **Induced Drag** due to the formation of trailing vortex systems at the wingtips
	c) **Wave drag** due to shock formation at high speeds

### Skin Friction Drag
This occurs when the aerofoil drags air along with it:

Tangential shear stress on the surface opposes the aircraft's motion.
Friction causes the flow very close to the surface to slow down, forming a boundary layer which grows downstream. This results in the shape of the body changing as the flow is displaced outwards, and also leads to flow separation and the formation of a turbulent wake.
The friction drag coefficient reduces with Reynolds number and is greater for turbulent flow than laminar flow.
### Form Drag
Front to rear asymmetry in surface pressure distribution generates **Form Drag**; it is sometimes referred to as pressure drag. The form drag coefficient increases with increasing wake size.

### Profile Drag
Profile drag is the combination of Skin Friction and Form Drag:
$$\text{Profile Drag = Skin Friction Drag + Form Drag}$$
