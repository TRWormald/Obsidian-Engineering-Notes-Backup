### Drag Breakdown
There are two underlying sources of drag:
1) **Skin friction drag**
	- Sometimes called **surface friction drag**
	- It is the streamwise component of the tangential stresses acting at the surface
	- It is a direct result of the fluid viscosity
2) **Pressure Drag**
	- The streamwise component of pressure forces acting **normal** to the surface
	- It consists of:
	a) **Form Drag** due to **Boundary Layer** growth
	b) **Induced Drag** due to the formation of trailing vortex systems at the wingtips
	c) **Wave drag** due to shock formation at high speeds
