### The Definitions of Lift and Drag

**Lift (L)** is the component of the aerodynamic force *perpendicular* to the relative wind.
**Drag (D)** is the component of the aerodynamic force *parallel* to the relative wind.
\
**Note that the lift is not always up! It is perpendicular to the plane of the wings.**
### Aerodynamic Forces

The Aerodynamic forces generated depend on:
- The shape and size of the body
- The free-stream velocity ($V_{\infty}$)
- The **incidence angle** or **angle of attack ($\alpha$)**, which is the angle between the chord line and the free stream velocity.
### The Aerodynamic Moment
There is also a **Pitching Moment** acting about a defined axis (usually the leading edge or quarter-chord point):

This is caused by the distribution of pressure over the wing.
