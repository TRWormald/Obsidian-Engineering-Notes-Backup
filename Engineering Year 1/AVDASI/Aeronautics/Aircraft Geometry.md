### Control Surfaces
An aircraft has several basic control surfaces which can be seen on the diagram below:

These have different effects:

| Control<br>Surface              | Axis it<br>Controls | Basic<br>Description  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Elevator ($\eta$, $\delta_{e}$) | Pitch               | +ve = nose up         |
| Rudder ($\zeta$, $\delta_{r}$)  | Yaw                 | +ve = nose to right   |
| Aileron ($\xi$, $\delta_{r}$)   | Roll                | +ve = right wing down |
### Wing Position
Many aircraft have different configurations of their wings for various performance related reasons, the following diagram shows some of the possible configurations:
