### Control Surfaces
An aircraft has several basic control surfaces which can be seen on the diagram below:

These have different effects:

| Control<br>Surface              | Axis it<br>Controls | Basic<br>Description  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Elevator ($\eta$, $\delta_{e}$) | Pitch               | +ve = nose up         |
| Rudder ($\zeta$, $\delta_{r}$)  | Yaw                 | +ve = nose to right   |
| Aileron ($\xi$, $\delta_{r}$)   | Roll                | +ve = right wing down |
### Wing Position
Many aircraft have different configurations of their wings for various performance related reasons, the following diagram shows some of the possible configurations:

### Wing Geometry
There are many different wing designs, however the most common/simple of them is the **Trapezoidal Wing**:

\
There are several important parameters that need to be considered:
- The **Wing Taper Ratio** - $\lambda= \frac{c_{t}}{c_{r}}$
- The **Standard Mean Chord** - $\bar{c}=\frac{S}{b}$
- The **Aspect Ratio** - $AR=\dfrac{b}{\bar{c}}=\dfrac{b^{2}}{S}$
- The **Mean Aerodynamic Chord** - $\bar{\bar{d}}=\frac{1}{S}\int_{-\frac{b}{2}}^{+\frac{b}{2}}c^{2}(y)\cdot dy$
