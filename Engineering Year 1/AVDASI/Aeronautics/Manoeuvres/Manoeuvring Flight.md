### Symmetric Manoeuvres
In a symmetrical manoeuvre the forces on the left and right sides of the aircraft are equal. This means that we can only consider manoeuvres where there is a variation in lift.
For example vertical manoeuvres (loops, pull-up, push-over, outside loop, etc.) but there are also horizontal manoeuvres like the banked turn.
The motion is curvilinear therefore there must be a resultant force perpendicular to the flight path in order to give a normal acceleration, so for a steady curved path with radius $R:$
$$F=ma=\frac{W}{g} \frac{V^{2}}{R}$$
### Load Factor
Load factor ($n$) is the ratio between the lift force generated in any given scenario ($L$) and the weight of the aircraft ($W$):
$$\boxed{n=\frac{L}{W}}$$
In straight and level flight $L=W$; therefore $n=1$.
The lift force variation can be large, for example for a 1:5 speed range results in a 1:25 variation in $\frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}$, so the load factor is limited by the structural design of our aircraft.
#### Normal Acceleration in a Loop
Consider a case with $\text{lift}=2\rightarrow \text{constant load factor } n=2$.

Note that the normal acceleration varies:
- 1g at point (1)
- 2g at point (2)
- 3g at point (3)
And that as a result the radius of the loop varies due to the interaction between gravity and inertia forces - when the normal acceleration is greater the radius of the turn will be smaller (Seen in our characteristic equation above $F\propto \frac{1}{R}$).
### Flight Envelope
#### Manoeuvre Envelope
The manoeuvre flight envelope is a diagram which shows load factor against [[Level Flight#The Equivalent Air Speed (EAS)| Equivalent Air Speed]]:
![[Pasted image 20240327155654.png|center]]
It shows the region in which the aircraft can fly defined by the load limits for positive and negative load factor, the stall boundary, and the maximum speed.
###### The Manoeuvre Point
The manoeuvre point is the point at which $C_{L}$ and $n$ are both at their maximum, which corresponds to the optimum load factor and coefficient of lift for **minimum turn radius, and maximum turn rate**.
![[Pasted image 20240327175201.png|center|450]]
On the stall boundary:
$$L=nW=\frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}SC_{L_{max}}$$
So:
$$\boxed{n=\frac{\rho V^{2}SC_{L_{max}}}{2W}}$$
The speed at the manoeuvre point $V^{*}$ is given by: 
$$\boxed{V^{*}=\sqrt{\frac{2n_{max}W}{\rho SC_{L_{max}}}}}$$
#### Gust Envelope
Aircraft will experience loads due to gusts (atmospheric turbulence). The most impactful type of gusts are **vertical gusts** as it affects the amount of lift generated by an aircraft through a change in AoA.
![[Pasted image 20240327180038.png|center|400]]
Increasing the lift increases the load factor which might lead to the aircraft straying outside of its load limits and resulting in structural failure.
Note how the faster you are flying the greater the impact of the gust on your load factor.
We consider the different gust velocities at different speeds:
- 66 ft/s at gust penetration speed $V_B$ (which is characteristic to each aircraft)
- 50 ft/s at Cruising Speed ($V_{C}$) (i.e. this is the maximum gust velocity the aircraft is expected to withstand when in cruise)
- 25 ft/s at Design Diving Speed ($V_{D}$) (i.e. this is the maximum gust velocity the aircraft is expected to withstand when in a dive)
Gust velocities are constant to 20,000 ft and reduce linearly up to 50,000 ft. 
Gust velocity lines are linear and pass through +1 (as seen in the graph above)
The load factor increases from +1 to $n$:
$$\boxed{n= \frac{\rho a_{1}v}{2W/S}V+1}$$
Where $v$ is the velocity of the gust, $V$ is the velocity of the aircraft, and $a_{1}$ is our lift curve slope.
#### Combined Envelope
We can then combine the manoeuvre envelope and the gust envelope to get a comprehensive 'combined envelope':
