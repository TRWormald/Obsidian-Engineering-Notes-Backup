### Equivalent Flows
For most real life scenarios we can create the same conditions using scale testing - which allows for cheaper and easier prototyping.
Below is an example:
\
*Consider an aircraft moving into still air at a speed* $V_{\text{aircraft}}$
*The upstream static pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure:*
![[Pasted image 20240426104622.png|center]]
We can replicate this by imagining the aircraft stationary in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel has steady onset flow of $V_{\text{aircraft}}$ and the inlet pressure is adjusted so that the static pressure of the onset flow is equal to atmospheric.

If the wind tunnel is large enough for the streamlines to be unaffected by the tunnel walls then the flow speed relative to the aircraft and the pressure would be identical in both cases.
This is due to us performing a [[The Galilean Transform|Galilean Transform]] on the first scenario to achieve the second.
**These are referred to as similar flows.**
