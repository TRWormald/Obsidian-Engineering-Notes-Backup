### Flow Over a Flat Plate
Consider a smooth steady uniform flow as it reaches the leading edge of a flat plate. Viscosity means that the flow will be zero at the surface and the resulting shear stress will cause a region if smoothly retarded flow to develop (the boundary layer). This can be seen below:

The bottom elements of the fluid are being slowed down, and these elements also slow down adjacent elements of fluid.
The boundary layer thickness $\delta$ is defined as the height above the surface where the velocity is 99% of the free stream value.
