**Note that laminar flow is flow which is in distinct layers, in the simplest case this is the boundary layer caused by viscosity and then a layer which has a flow rate equal to the freestream velocity.**
### Flow Over a Flat Plate
Consider a smooth steady uniform flow as it reaches the leading edge of a flat plate. Viscosity means that the flow will be zero at the surface and the resulting shear stress will cause a region if smoothly retarded flow to develop (the boundary layer). This can be seen below:

The bottom elements of the fluid are being slowed down, and these elements also slow down adjacent elements of fluid.
The boundary layer thickness $\delta$ is defined as the height above the surface where the velocity is 99% of the free stream value. 
### Viscous Effects & Reynolds Number
$$Re= \frac{\rho VL}{\mu}=\frac{VL}{v}=\frac{\text{inertia force}}{\text{viscous force}}$$
The Reynolds number is the ratio of inertia force to viscous force, and can be calculated using the equation above, where: $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $V$ is the velocity, $L$ is an arbitrary but physically significant length (e.g. diameter for pipe flows, distance from the leading edge for flows along surfaces, the chord for aerofoils and wings, depth for boundary layer flows, etc.), and a constant of viscosity ($\mu$ is the bulk viscosity and $v$ is the kinematic velocity where $v=\frac{\mu}{\rho}$).
**Low Re** means that the viscous forces are important over the entire flow, whilst **High Re** means that significant viscous effects are confined to a thin region near the body.
There is a **Transition Re** where for any Re above some critical value viscous forces are no longer sufficient to damp disturbances and the flow becomes turbulent.
