### Attached Flow over a Streamlined Body
For a streamlined body we can visualise the streamlines as follows:
![[Pasted image 20240320111455.png|center]]As the distance between streamlines changes the pressure and volume change:
If streamlines get closer together $V\uparrow~p\downarrow$
If streamlines get further apart $V\downarrow~p\uparrow$
### Sharp Edge Separation
Viscosity effectively 'prohibits' flow around sharp corners; flow around small radii leads to high local velocities and high local velocity gradients - this is not a problem in an inviscid fluid but in a fluid with viscosity very high shear forces are created which tend to prevent the flow 'turning the corner'.

### Boundary Layer Separation
Separation is defined by the pressure gradient, when the flow is:
- Accelerating - this is a "favourable" pressure gradient (pressure falling)
- Decelerating - this is an "adverse" pressure gradient (pressure rising)
\
Sharp expansions lead to high "adverse" pressure gradients and therefore separation.
\
Laminar flow separates much earlier than turbulent flow, which is important as the onset of flow separation has a major impact on the rest of the flow field.

### Streamlines over Smooth Bluff Bodies (e.g. spheres)
Remembering what we know about the [[Fluid Behaviour - Laminar Flow#Viscous Effects & Reynolds Number|Reynolds Number]] we can see how the flow over a sphere changes with velocity:

We are primarily interested in high Re flow - for which there are three main categories:
1) Subcritical ($Re_{d}\approx 4\times 10^{2}\text{ to }3\times 10^{5}$) which presents early laminar separation
2) Critical ($Re_{d}\approx 3\times 10^{5}\text{ to }3\times 10^{6}$) which presents a laminar separation bubble, followed by delayed turbulent separation.
3) Supercritical ($Re_{d}>3\times 10^{6}$) which presents turbulent separation
\
These conditions can be seen in the three diagrams on the right in the image above in their corresponding order.
Note that the wider the wake the higher the suction and hence the greater the drag.
