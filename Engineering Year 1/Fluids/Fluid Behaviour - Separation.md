### Attached Flow over a Streamlined Body
For a streamlined body we can visualise the streamlines as follows:
![[Pasted image 20240320111455.png|center]]As the distance between streamlines changes the pressure and volume change:
If streamlines get closer together $V\uparrow~p\downarrow$
If streamlines get further apart $V\downarrow~p\uparrow$
### Sharp Edge Separation
Viscosity effectively 'prohibits' flow around sharp corners; flow around small radii leads to high local velocities and high local velocity gradients - this is not a problem in an inviscid fluid but in a fluid with viscosity very high shear forces are created which tend to prevent the flow 'turning the corner'.

### Boundary Layer Separation
Separation is defined by the pressure gradient, when the flow is:
- Accelerating - this is a "favourable" pressure gradient (pressure falling)
- Decelerating - this is an "adverse" pressure gradient (pressure rising)
\
Sharp expansions lead to high "adverse" pressure gradients and therefore separation.
