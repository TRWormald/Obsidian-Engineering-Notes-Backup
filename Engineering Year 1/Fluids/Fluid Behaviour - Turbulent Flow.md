Turbulent flow can be considered to consist of a large number of *eddies* of varying size and frequencies, flowing with the stream and interacting with each other as they do so.
Large eddies interact with each other and produce smaller eddies, which then interact with each other to cause even smaller eddies - this process continues until the eddies are small enough to be dissipated by the action of viscosity.

>The analysis of turbulent motion remains the outstanding problem in fluid dynamics (and indeed all of applied mathematics) today.

In detail, turbulent flow is unsteady, 3D and (apparently) random. However, when it is time-averaged the flow becomes steady.
### Turbulent Boundary Layer
In [[Fluid Behaviour - Laminar Flow#Flow Over a Flat Plate|Laminar Flow]] shear stress (viscosity) is due to lateral momentum transfer at the molecular level.
In turbulent flow 'large-scale' mixing provides an additional mechanism for lateral momentum transfer - this means that the effective shear stress is greatly increased.
The graph below shows the velocity profile of both laminar and turbulent flow.

We can see that the velocity doesn't return to the freestream's magnitude until much later in the turbulent flow and that the velocity reduces to zero much faster in comparison to the laminar flow.
### Turbulence Transition Mechanism
Transition from laminar to turbulent flow can be idealised by the stages shown below:

However, in analysis transition is often taken as instantaneous. The factors that have a strong effec
