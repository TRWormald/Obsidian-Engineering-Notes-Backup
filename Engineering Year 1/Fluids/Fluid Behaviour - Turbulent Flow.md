Turbulent flow can be considered to consist of a large number of *eddies* of varying size and frequencies, flowing with the stream and interacting with each other as they do so.
Large eddies interact with each other and produce smaller eddies, which then interact with each other to cause even smaller eddies - this process continues until the eddies are small enough to be dissipated by the action of viscosity.

>The analysis of turbulent motion remains the outstanding problem in fluid dynamics (and indeed all of applied mathematics) today.

In detail, turbulent flow is unsteady, 3D and (apparently) random. However, when it is time-averaged the flow becomes steady.
