### Pathlines
These are the path traced by an element of fluid over an interval in time. They are specific to single elements of fluids.
Below is an example of a pathline.

### Streaklines
A streakline is the trace joining instantaneous positions of fluid elements which have passed through a given point (i.e. shown by smoke or dye injection).

As the elements passed through the given point we can imagine them taking on some dye or smoke and carrying it with them, resulting in the image above.
### Streamlines
A streamline is the curve drawn from the flow field at an instant in time, whose tangent at any point is in the direction of the velocity vector at that point. Hence there is no flow perpendicular to a streamline; streamlines can only cross at stagnation points (where the velocity is zero) as the velocity at any point has only one value or direction. An example of a streamline is below:

The 3D equivalent of a streamline is a stream tube.
###
Pathlines, streaklines and streamlines are identical in **steady flow**, but in general unsteady flows they are different. (However this year we will only be solving steady flows.)
