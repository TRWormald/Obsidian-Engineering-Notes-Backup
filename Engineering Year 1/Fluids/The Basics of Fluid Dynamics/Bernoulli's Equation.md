According to Bernoulli's Equation the total pressure at all points along a [[Fluid Behaviour - Streamlines|Streamline]] is constant, this means that the sum of the **static**, **hydrostatic**, and **dynamic** pressures is the same for any two points.
This results in the equation:
$$\underbrace{p_{1}}_\text{Static Pressure}+\underbrace{\rho g h_{1}}_\text{Hydrostatic Pressure}+ \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}\rho V_{1}^{2}}_\text{Dynamic Pressure}=\text{Constant}$$
Therefore (applying the fact that it is constant between points):
$$p_{1}+\rho g h_{1}+ \frac{1}{2}\rho V_{1}^{2}=p_{2}+\rho g h_{2}+ \frac{1}{2}\rho V_{2}^{2}$$
\
This allows us to calculate information about the pressure or velocity at a point, or the difference in vertical height between two points - if we are given enough information to solve the equation.
\
Using Bernoulli's Equation we can derive the statement we saw in [[Pressure]] about the pressure at two points in a fluid being equal if they were on the same horizontal plane and were connected through the fluid:
\
If we apply Bernoulli's Equation we can see that $h=0$ which means that the hydrostatic term drops out, and if we assume that the fluid is static (i.e. it has no velocity) then we get:
$$p_{1}=p_{2}$$
