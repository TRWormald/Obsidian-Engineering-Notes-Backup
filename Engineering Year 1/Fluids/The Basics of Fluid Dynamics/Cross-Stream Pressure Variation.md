If we consider the forces in the cross-stream direction ($n$) due to acceleration normal to a streamline with radius of curvature $r_s$ - we can (using conservation of momentum) derive an equation for how the pressure changes in the cross stream direction:
$$ \frac{\partial p}{\partial n}+\rho g \frac{\partial z}{\partial n}=\rho \frac{V^{2}}{r_{s}}$$
The only assumption made for this was that the flow is steady and therefore it is valid **for all steady flows**. Solving the equation is difficult but it gives useful insights.

In a lot of analysis we assume that [[Fluid Behaviour - Streamlines|Streamlines]] are straight and parallel, hence:
$$r_{s}\rightarrow \infty~~~~,~~~~ \rho \frac{V^{2}}{r_{s}}\rightarrow 0$$
This results in:
$$ \frac{\partial p}{\partial n}+\rho g \frac{\partial z}{\partial n}=\underbrace{\rho \frac{V^{2}}{r_{s}}}_{\rightarrow 0}=0$$
In two common examples we can apply this to gain an insight into how pressure varies:

In the example on the left (where the flow is horizontal) the vertical height changes on a one to one basis with $n$ so they form the hydrostatic term, hence as $h$ increases $p$ increases.
In the example on the right (where the flow is vertical) as $\frac{\partial z }{\partial n}=0$ there is no change in pressure through the fluid and hence the pressure in the jet is equal to atmospheric pressure.

This is even the case for horizontal jets as we assume that the radius of the curvature is large and the jet width is small, so the horizontal jet is straight and parallel.
