The most basic definition of pressure is:
$$p=\frac{F}{A}$$
Or pressure is equal to the force applied per unit area - acting on the walls of a container or a surface. It is the result of molecules hitting the container walls at some velocity.
\
**On a submerged body pressure acts normal to the surface.**
### Pressure Variation in a Static Fluid
A height variation in a fluid will invariably lead to a pressure variation between the two points due to the additional/lesser weight of fluid above.
We can represent this using the equation:
$$\delta p =\rho g \delta z$$
Where $\delta p$ is the change/difference in pressure between the two points $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\delta z$ is the difference in height between the two points.
An important fact to remember is:
\
**"The pressure at any two points on a horizontal plane is the same so long as they are connected by a line wholly in the fluid."**
