Often the best way to represent how much fluid is flowing through a system is using the mass flow rate. This is merely an expression of the conservation of mass - as the mass of fluid that enters a pipe/system must come out of the other end.
This gives us the equation:
$$\rho_{1}A_{1}V_{1}=\rho_{2}A_{2}V_{2}$$
However for incompressible flow (where $\rho$ is constant):
$$A_{1}V_{1}=A_{2}V_{2}$$
**It is important to note that this is valid for both viscous as well as inviscid flows**
