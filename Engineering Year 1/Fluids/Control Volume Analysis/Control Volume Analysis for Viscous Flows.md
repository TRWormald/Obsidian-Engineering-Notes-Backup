### Pipe Flow Losses - The Effect of Viscosity
Pressure loss due to friction in a straight pipe can be accurately calculated in terms of length $L$, diameter $D$, and average velocity (or centreline velocity) $V$, via the Darcy-Weisbach equation:
$$\Delta p_{loss}=f_{D} \frac{{L}}{{D}} \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}$$
Where $f_{D}$ is the friction factor - which is plotted on a Moody Diagram as a function of Reynolds Number, $Re_{D}=\frac{VD}{v}$ and relative roughness $\frac{\varepsilon}{D}$.
We can then apply this to [[Bernoulli's Equation]] to represent the change in pressure as a result of friction:
$$p_{1}+ \frac{1}{2}\rho V_{1}^{2}+\rho gz_{1}=p_{2}+ \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}_{2}+\rho g z_{2}+\Delta p_{loss}$$
If we solve this for the pressure loss:
$$\Delta p +\rho g \Delta z=f_{D} \frac{L}{D} \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}$$
As the velocity at 1 and 2 must be the same, and therefore the dynamic pressures cancel out.
We can also represent this using an 'equivalent height' or pressure head in the fluid:
$$\Delta p+\rho g\Delta z=\rho g \Delta h$$
Where $\Delta h$ is the change in height relative to a fixed point, allowing us to show how the viscous effects have changed.
This leads into the idea of the 'grade line', GL.
For inviscid flow the grade line is flat as there is no loss in pressure and dyn
