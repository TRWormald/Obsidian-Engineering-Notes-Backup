### Pipe Flow Losses - The Effect of Viscosity
Pressure loss due to friction in a straight pipe can be accurately calculated in terms of length $L$, diameter $D$, and average velocity (or centreline velocity) $V$, via the Darcy-Weisbach equation:
$$\Delta p_{loss}=f_{D} \frac{{L}}{{D}} \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}$$
Where $f_{D}$ is the friction factor - which is plotted on a Moody Diagram as a function of Reynolds Number, $Re_{D}=\frac{VD}{v}$ and relative roughness $\frac{\varepsilon}{D}$.
We can then apply this to [[Bernoulli's Equation]] to represent the change in pressure as a result of friction:
$$p_{1}+ \frac{1}{2}\rho V_{1}^{2}+\rho gz_{1}=p_{2}+ \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}_{2}+\rho g z_{2}+\Delta p_{loss}$$
