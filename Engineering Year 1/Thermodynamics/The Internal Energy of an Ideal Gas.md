The Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas is solely dependant on its temperature, as result the change in its internal energy is equal to the heat transferred to get it to change temperature.

$$\Delta U = m c_{v} \Delta T$$
Where:
$\Delta U$ is the change in internal energy
$m$ is the mass of gas ($kg$)
$c_{v}$ is the [[Specific Heat Capacity at Constant Volume]] for the Gas ($J/(kg \cdot K)$)
$\Delta T$ is the change in temperature ($K$)
