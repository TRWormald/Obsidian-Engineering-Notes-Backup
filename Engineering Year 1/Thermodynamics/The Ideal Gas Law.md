The ideal gas law can be used to describe the state of an ideal gas and relates pressure, volume, size of the system, and temperature. The following equation describes that relationship:


$$pV=mRT$$
Where:
$p$ is there pressure in Pascals ($Pa/Nm^{-2}$)
$V$ is the volume ($m^3$)
m is the mass of gas ($kg$)
R is the [[Specific Gas Constant]] ($J/(kg \cdot K)$)
T is the temperature of the gas ($K$)

It is also possible to rewrite this equation using intensive (i.e. independent of system size) properties:

$$pv=RT$$
Where:
$p$ is there pressure in Pascals ($Pa/Nm^{-2}$)
$v$ is the specific density ($m^3/kg$)
R is the [[Specific Gas Constant]] ($J/(kg \cdot K)$)
T is the temperature of the gas ($K$)

Note:
The State Postulate applies to these equations, so if the system is in equilibrium we can find all of the properties of the system if we have at least two of them.
