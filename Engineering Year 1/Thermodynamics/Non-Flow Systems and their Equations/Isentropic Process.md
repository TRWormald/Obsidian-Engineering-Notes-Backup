This is a derivative of theÂ [[Non-Flow Energy Equation]] where the entropy of the system is kept constant (And as a result there is no heat addition). However we use a different equation to relate pressure ($p$) and volume ($V$):
\
$$pV^\gamma=C=constant$$
Where:
\
$$\gamma = \frac{c_p}{c_v}=\frac{\tilde R+c_v}{c_v}$$
\
$c_p$ is [[Specific Heat Capacity at Constant Pressure]]
$c_v$ is [[Specific Heat Capacity at Constant Volume]]
$\tilde R$ is the [[Specific Gas Constant]]
\
The first equation can be rearranged to make pressure the subject and then integrated to give the work done which will equal the change in internal energy:
\
$$mc_v \Delta T = -\int _a^b CV^{-\gamma} \cdot dV$$
\
Following through with this we get:
$$\Delta U = -\frac{p_2 V_2 - p_1 V_1}{\gamma - 1}$$
\
Resulting in the conclusion that the change in the internal energy of the system is related to the difference between the products of its pressure and volume in each state.
Sometimes the Isentropic process is called [[Adiabatic]], this is true however the reverse isn't. An Isentropic process is a **reversible** [[Adiabatic]] process.

###### Alternate Equations
Using the [[State Postulate]] we know that if our system is in equilibrium then we can find any property of our system given two of the other properties. As a result we can derive the following:
\
$$ C=Tp^{\frac{1-\gamma}{\gamma}}$$
$$T=Cp^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}$$
$$\frac{T_1}{T_2}=\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{1-\gamma}{\gamma}}$$
$$p=CT^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}$$
$$T_{2}=T_{1}\left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)^{\gamma-1}$$
