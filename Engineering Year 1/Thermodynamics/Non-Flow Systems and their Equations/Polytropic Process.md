This is a derivative of theÂ [[Non-Flow Energy Equation]] which is most similar to the real process that we would observe, it has some similarity to the [[Isentropic Process]] which we will use to skip several steps of working:
\
For the [[Polytropic Process]]:
\
$$pV^n=C=constant$$
\
Where:
$$n<\gamma=\frac{c_p}{c_v}$$
\
The similarities in the equation lead us to the following relationship between change in internal energy, net heat transfer and work done:
\
$$\Delta U = Q - \frac{p_2 V_2 - p_1 v_1}{n - 1}$$
\
###### Alternate Equations
Using the [[State Postulate]] we know that if our system is in equilibrium then we can find any property of our system given two of the other properties. As a result we can derive the following:
\
$$ C=Tp^{\frac{1-n}{n}}$$
$$T=Cp^{\frac{n-1}{n}}$$
$$\frac{T_1}{T_2}=\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{1-n}{n}}$$
$$p=CT^{\frac{n}{n-1}}$$
$$T_{2}=T_{1}\left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)^{n-1}$$
