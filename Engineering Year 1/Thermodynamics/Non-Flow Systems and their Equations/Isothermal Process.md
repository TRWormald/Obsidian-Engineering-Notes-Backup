This is a derivative of theÂ [[Non-Flow Energy Equation]] where the temperature of the system is kept constant. As a result there cannot be any change in the internal energy as any change in [[The Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas]] is directly proportional to the change in temperature.

Reviewing the [[Non-Flow Energy Equation]]:
\
$$0 = Q + W$$
If we apply our knowledge of [[The Work Equation for Non-Constant Force]]:
\
$$ Q-\int_a^b p \cdot dV=0$$
And then combining a rearrangement of [[The Ideal Gas Law]]:
\
$$ Q=\int_a^b \frac{mRT}{V} \cdot dV $$
Where:
$m$ is the amount of gas/fluid in the system ($kg$)
$R$ is the [[Specific Gas Constant]]
$T$ is the temperature of the system ($K$)
$V$ is the volume of the system ($m^3$)

Completing this integral gives:
\
$$Q=mRT\ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)$$
Where:
$V_2$ is the volume at the end of the process ($m^3$)
$V_1$ is the volume at the start of the process ($m^3$)
