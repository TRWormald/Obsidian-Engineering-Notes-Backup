This is a derivative of theÂ [[Non-Flow Energy Equation]] where the pressure of the system is kept constant. Considering what we know about [[The Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas]] and [[The Work Equation for Non-Constant Force]] we can form the equation:

$$mc_v \Delta T = Q- \int^b_a p\cdot dV$$
However as pressure is constant completing the integral gives:
$$ mc_v \Delta T = Q-p(V_2-V_1)$$
Note that this is an introduction to [[Enthalpy]] as the term $Q= \Delta U + p \Delta V$ is very common throughout Thermodynamics and as such is given the name.
