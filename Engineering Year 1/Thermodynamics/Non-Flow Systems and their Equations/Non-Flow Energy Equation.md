*"There exists a property of a closed system such that a change in its value is equal to the sum of the net heat and work transfers during any change of state"* 

The Non-Flow Energy Equation is what we use when we want to analyse a partial/incomplete cycle, the internal energy is the sum of all microscopic energies (like electrostatic potential energy etc.) and the net heat and work transfers are changing that internal energy.

$$\Delta U = Q + W$$
Where:
$\Delta U$ is the change in internal energy in Joules ($J$)
$Q$ is the net heat transfer in Joules ($J$)
$W$ is the net work transfer in Joules ($J$)
