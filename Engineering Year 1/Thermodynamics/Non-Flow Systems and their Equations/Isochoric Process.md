This is a derivative of the [[Non-Flow Energy Equation]] where the volume of the system is kept constant. As a result there cannot be any work done by/to the system. (As for work to be done there must be a change in volume, see [[The Work Equation for Non-Constant Force]])

Referring to the [[Non-Flow Energy Equation]]:
\
$$\Delta U = Q $$
Hence as $\Delta U$ (for an ideal gas) is directly proportional to the change in temperature (See [[The Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas]]):
\
$$Q=mc_v \Delta T$$
Where:
$Q$ is the heat transferred to/from the system ($J$)
$m$ is the amount of gas/fluid in the system ($kg$)
$c_v$ is the [[Specific Heat Capacity at Constant Volume]] ($J/(kg \cdot K$)
$\Delta T$ is the change in temperature of the system ($^oK$)
