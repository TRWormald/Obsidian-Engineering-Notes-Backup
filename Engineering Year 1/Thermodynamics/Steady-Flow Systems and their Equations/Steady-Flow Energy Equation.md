Steady flow is in many ways very similar to non-flow systems due to the fact that the amount of mass that is within our working area is remaining constant (as the flow rate in and out are the same).
It is a very powerful system that has lots of use in many systems from power plants to jet and rocket engines.
Unlike with non-flow systems we need to consider the [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] and [[Kinetic Energy]] of the working fluid.
\
As a result we end up with the following equation:
\
$$\dot{W}+\dot{Q}=\dot{m} \left[ (h_2+\frac{1}{2}c_2^2+gz_2)-(h_1+\frac{1}{2}c_1^2+gz_1)\right]$$
\
Where:
$\dot{W}$ is the work rate
$\dot{Q}$ is the rate of net heat transfer
$\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate
$h$ is the specific [[Enthalpy]] (Or the Enthalpy per unit mass of the system)
$c$ is the speed at which the fluid is moving
$z$ is the vertical height above the datum
