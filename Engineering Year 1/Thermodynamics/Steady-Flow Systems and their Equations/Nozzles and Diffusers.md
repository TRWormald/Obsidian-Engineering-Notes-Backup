Nozzles and Diffusers change the velocity and pressure of a fluid. Nozzles increase both while diffusers decrease both.
One commonality between the two is that we usually neglect the velocity at the largest cross section - this is because a change in area of any significant amount results in an exponentially greater change in velocity (as the two are related by the square).
\
No work or heat addition occurs during either of these processes so the following equation is a simple rearrangement of the [[Steady-Flow Energy Equation]]:
\
$$ 0=\dot{m} \left[(h_2+\frac{1}{2}c_2^2)-(h_1+\frac{1}{2}c_1^2) \right]$$
\
This equation is valid for both Nozzles and Diffusers but one must take care to eliminate the correct velocity. (i.e. for a nozzle you should disregard $c_1$ and in a diffuser you should disregard $c_2$)
