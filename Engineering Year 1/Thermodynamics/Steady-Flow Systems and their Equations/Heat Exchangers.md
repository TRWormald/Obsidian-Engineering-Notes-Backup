A heat exchanger takes in some fluid and either adds or removes heat to/from it. We neglect pressure loss and assume that it is an [[Isobaric Process]] that takes place within the exchanger.
This results in the following simplification of the [[Steady-Flow Energy Equation]]:
\
$$\dot{Q}=\dot{m}(h_2-h_1)$$
\
And as:
\
$$h=c_p\cdot T$$
Therefore:
$$\dot{Q}=\dot{m}(T_2-T_1)$$
\
So the rate of net heat transfer is proportional to the change in temperature.
