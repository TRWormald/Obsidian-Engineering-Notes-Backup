For Turbines and Compressors work is either done (in the case of compressors) to increase the pressure and temperature of the fluid or extracted (in the case of a turbine) which results in a decrease in pressure and temperature.
\
There must be some rate of work but no heat is being transferred so the rearrangement of the [[Steady-Flow Energy Equation]] is as follows:
\
$$\dot{W}=\dot{m}\left[(h_2+\frac{1}{2}c_2^2)-(h_1+\frac{1}{2}c_1^2)\right]$$
\
There exists an important factor, called the pressure ratio, which relates the maximum and minimum pressures produced by the Turbine/Compressor:
\
$$ r_p=\frac{p_{max}}{p_{min}}$$
\
Also note that Turbines and Compressors are typically modelled as isentropic so:
\
$$T_2=T_1\left(\frac{p_1}{p_2}\right)^{\frac{1-\gamma}{\gamma}}$$
\
It is also important to note that typically $\Delta KE <<\Delta H$ and as a result can be neglected, resulting in:
\
$$\dot{W}=\dot{m}[h_2-h_1]$$
\
So the work rate (Or power) is proportional to the mass flow rate (which is constant), and the change in specific [[Enthalpy]].

See the [[Isentropic Efficiencies of Turbines and Compressors]] to compare the ideal and real efficiency of these components.
