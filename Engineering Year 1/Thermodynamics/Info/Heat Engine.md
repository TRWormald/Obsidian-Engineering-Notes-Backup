A heat engine is a black box component of a thermodynamic system which receives heat and outputs some useful work.
\
If we refer to [[The First Law of Thermodynamics]] we can calculate the efficiency of the heat engine:
As energy is conserved:
$$W_{out} = Q_{in}-Q_{out}$$
So the efficiency can be calculated as:
$$\eta = \frac{W_{out}}{Q_{in}}=1-\frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{in}}$$
\
Note the limitations of only using [[The First Law of Thermodynamics]], as this allows for the efficiency to be 100% as we could theoretically have a heat engine which converted all of the input heat into work. However [[The Second Law of Thermodynamics]] tells us that this is impossible.
\
So technically:
$$\eta =1-\frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{in}}<1$$
