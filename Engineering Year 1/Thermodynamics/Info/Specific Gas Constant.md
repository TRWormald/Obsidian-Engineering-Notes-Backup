The Specific Gas Constant is unique to every different gas/mixture. It comes from the Universal Gas Constant being divided by the molar mass of the gas/mixture we want to find the [[Specific Gas Constant]] of.

So:
$$\tilde{R}=\frac{R}{\tilde{m}}$$
Where:
$\tilde{R}$ is the [[Specific Gas Constant]]
$R$ is the Universal Gas Constant (8.314 $J/mol$)
$\tilde{m}$ is the Molar Mass of the Gas

Note:
It is important to know that the Specific Gas Constant for Air is 287 $J/(kg \cdot K)$
