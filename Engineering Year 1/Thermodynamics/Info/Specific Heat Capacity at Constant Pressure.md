The Specific Heat Capacity at Constant Pressure is the amount of energy it takes to increase the temperature of a gas/fluid/object massing 1 $kg$ by 1 $^oK$ without increasing the pressure.

$$c_{p} = c_{v} + R$$
Where:
$c_p$ is the [[Specific Heat Capacity at Constant Pressure]]
$c_v$ is the [[Specific Heat Capacity at Constant Volume]]
$R$ is the [[Specific Gas Constant]]
