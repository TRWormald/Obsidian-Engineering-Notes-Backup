"Enthalpy is the measurement of energy in a thermodynamic system. The quantity of enthalpy equals to the total content of heat of a system, equivalent to the system's internal energy plus the product of volume and pressure."
\
$$H=U+pV$$
\
Where:
$H$ is the Enthalpy
$U$ is the Internal Energy
$p$ is the Pressure
$V$ is the Volume
\
Remembering the equation for [[The Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas]]:
\
$$\Delta H=mc_v\Delta T$$
\
As for an Ideal Gas $pV$ is constant so it cancels out - resulting in the change in Enthalpy being directly proportional to the change in temperature.
