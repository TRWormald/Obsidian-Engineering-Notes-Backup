The sign convention followed in Thermodynamics states that:
1) Any Energy lost by the system is 'negative'
2) Any Energy gained by the system is 'positive'

For Example:
Consider a closed system - that system 'gains' 10 kJ of heat which would be represented as +10 kJ in our equations. The system then does 10 kJ of work to the surroundings, which is the system 'losing' energy and as such is represented as -10 kJ in our equations.
