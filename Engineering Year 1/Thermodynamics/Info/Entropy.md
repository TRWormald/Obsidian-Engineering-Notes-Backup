"*There exists a property of a closed system such that a change in its value is equal to $\int_1^2 \frac{dQ}{T}$ (where $dQ$ is the change in net heat and $T$ is the temperature of the system) for any reversible process undergone by the system between state 1 and state 2.*"
\
So, for a reversible process:
\
$$S_2 - S_1=\int_1^2\frac{dQ}{T}$$
\
However for an irreversible process, entropy is generated:
\
$$S_2 - S_1 = \int_1^2\frac{Q_{12}}{T}+S_{gen}$$
\
Where $S_{gen}$ is equal to the entropy generated by the process.
