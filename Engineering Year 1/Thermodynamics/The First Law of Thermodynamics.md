For a closed cycle energy is conserved, therefore  the sum of all heat transfers added to all of the work done by/to the system must be equal to zero (This is true due to the [[Thermodynamic Sign Convention]]).
This is represented in the equation below:
$$\sum Q + \sum W = 0$$
Where:
$Q$ is the heat transferred in Joules ($J$)
W is the work done in Joules ($J$)
