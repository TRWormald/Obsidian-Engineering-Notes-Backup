The simplest equation for work done is in the case of constant force:
$$W=F \cdot d$$
Where the work done ($W$) is equal to the force applied ($F$) multiplied by the perpendicular distance travelled ($d$).
However when we have a moving boundary system the force applied is often not constant with respect to time due to changes in pressure.
In a non-Isobaric system with a moving boundary the work done by the system on the surroundings won't be constant. As a result:

$$F=pA$$
$$s=\frac{V}{A}$$
$$W=Fs$$
So:
$$W=pA \cdot \frac{V}{A} = p \delta V$$
Hence the work done is equal to the change in volume of the system. We can then integrate to find the total amount of work done:

$$W=-\int p \cdot dV$$

Note that the work done is negative as energy is leaving the system when work is being done to increase the volume (i.e. imagine a piston cylinder increasing in volume to drive a crank shaft)
