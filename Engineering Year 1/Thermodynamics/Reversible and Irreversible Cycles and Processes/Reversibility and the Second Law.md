Not all processes are reversible, however according to the first law all quasi-equilibrium processes are reversible, and isentropic processes are adiabatic and frictionless.
According to the second law:
*For a process to be reversible, both the system and the surroundings must be able to be returned to their original states.*
\
We often model processes as being reversible as they are easier to model than real processes and provide an ideal to compare real processes against. Irreversible processes include: heat transfer, friction, electrical resistance, mixing fluids, chemical reactions, and many more.
##### Considering Heat Transfer

As we know from [[The Second Law of Thermodynamics]] we cant move heat from a cold [[Reservoir]] to a hot one without doing work, so the heat returned is greater than the initial amount of heat transferred, hence it is irreversible.
##### Friction

Some work is done by the mixing arm, resulting in an increase in thermal energy. That thermal energy leaves the system as heat, and as we know heat transfer is an irreversible process - so friction is an irreversible process.
##### Friction in Gases

When the stopper is removed the gas expands and the piston accelerates upwards. Friction occurs during this process, so it cannot be a reversible process.
