__The Kelvin-Planck Statement of the Second Law__
"*It is impossible to construct a system which will operate in a cycle, extract heat from a reservoir, and do an equivalent amount of work on the surroundings*"
 \
 This effectively means that you cant have a system which is 100% efficient, i.e. you cant convert all the heat you add to a system into work.

 __The Clausius Statement of the Second Law__
 "*It is impossible to construct a system which will operate in a cycle and transfer heat from a cooler body to a hotter body without work being done by the surroundings*"
 \
 This effectively means that you cant transfer heat from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir without doing work.
