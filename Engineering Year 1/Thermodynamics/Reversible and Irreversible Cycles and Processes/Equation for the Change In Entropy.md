If we consider an infinitesimally small change in internal energy, achieved by a reversible process:
\
Applying the [[Non-Flow Energy Equation]]:
\
$$ dU=dQ + dW$$
\
And substituting in the equation for [[Entropy]]:
\
$$dU=T\cdot dS + dW$$
\
And substituting [[The Work Equation for Non-Constant Force]]:
\
$$dU=T\cdot dS -p\cdot dV$$
\
Solving to make $dS$ the subject:
\
$$dS=\frac{dU}{T}+p\frac{dV}{T}$$
Which is the equation for the change in entropy in terms of four other properties. According to the state postulate we should be able to calculate it using only two:
\
Using the equation for [[The Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas]]:
\
$$ dS = \frac{mc_v\cdot dT}{T}+p\frac{dV}{T}$$
\
And then using [[The Ideal Gas Law]] with specific volume:
\
$$ dS = \frac{mc_v\cdot dT}{T}+\frac{RT}{v}\frac{dV}{T}$$
\
Dividing through by the mass gives:
\
$$ ds = c_v \frac{dT}{T}+R\frac{dv}{v}$$
\
Integrating between states 1 and 2:
\
$$s_2-s_1=c_v~ ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)+R ~ln\left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right)$$
