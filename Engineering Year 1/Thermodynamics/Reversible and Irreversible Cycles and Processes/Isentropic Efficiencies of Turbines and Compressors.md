The real work output of turbines and compressors differs from their ideal output:

\
This results in:
\
The isentropic efficiency of a turbine:
$$ \eta_T=\frac{\dot{W}_{out}}{\dot{W}_{out}^{'}}$$
The isentropic efficiency of a compressor:
$$ \eta_C=\frac{\dot{W}_{in}^{'}}{\dot{W}_{in}}$$
\
Note that these figures don't represent the efficiency of the components, rather it is comparing the real efficiency to the maximum theoretical efficiency.
