The best cycles have minimum work input and maximum work output - i.e. they follow reversible processes.
\
The Carnot Cycle is an example of a fully reversible cycle:

\
It consists of four stages:
- Isothermal heat addition at $T_H$ (1-2)
- Adiabatic (isentropic) expansion (2-3)
- Isothermal heat rejection at $T_C$ (3-4)
- Adiabatic (isentropic) compression (4-1)
\
The Carnot Cycle has efficiency equal to:
$$\eta = 1-\frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{in}}=1-\frac{T_C}{T_H}$$
So the greater the difference between the temperatures the higher the efficiency of the cycle.
We can compare any other cycle to this to see how well it performs as this is the maximum possible efficiency of a cycle operating between two reservoirs.
