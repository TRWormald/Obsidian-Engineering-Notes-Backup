The **angular momentum** of a rigid body about point $O$ can be calculated using:
$$\vec{H}_{O}=\vec{H}_{G}+\vec{r}_{G}\times \vec{p}=I_{G}\omega+mv_{G}d$$
![[Pasted image 20240506171923.png|center|450]]
Where $\vec{p}$ is the linear momentum of the body, $\vec{H}_G$ is the angular momentum about the centre of mass, which is equal to:
$$H_{G}=I_{G}\cdot\omega$$
Where $I_{G}$ is [[The Moment of Inertia]].

Furthermore the **change in angular momentum** is equal to the moments applied about that point:
$$\vec{M}_{O}=\dot{\vec{H}}_O$$
