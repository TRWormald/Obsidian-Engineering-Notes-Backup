The rotation of a rigid body is described by angular position $\theta$:

And the angular velocity ($\omega$),the rate of change of angle, can be calculated via:
$$\omega=\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\dot{\theta}$$
\
**It is important to note that the choice of reference axis or physical point of rotation does not affect the definition of angular velocity or angular acceleration:**

This is because, as $\beta$ is a constant, when we differentiate the constant term drops out.
