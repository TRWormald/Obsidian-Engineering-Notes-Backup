Angular acceleration is defined as the time derivative of [[Angular Velocity]].
So:
$$\alpha=\frac{d\omega}{dt}=\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}=\ddot{\theta}$$
\
Similarly to the identity in the kinematics of particles we can rearrange this to give:
$$\alpha\cdot d\theta=\omega \cdot d\omega$$
Which we can use to solve some problems by integrating.
