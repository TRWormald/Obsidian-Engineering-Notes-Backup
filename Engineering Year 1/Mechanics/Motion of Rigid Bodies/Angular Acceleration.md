Angular acceleration is defined as the time derivative of [[Angular Velocity]].
So:
$$\alpha=\frac{d\omega}{dt}=\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}=\ddot{\theta}$$
\
Similarly to the identity in the kinematics of particles we can rearrange this to give:
$$\alpha\cdot d\theta=\omega \cdot d\omega$$
Which we can use to solve some problems by integrating.
### Tangential Acceleration in Gears
Note that when two gears interface the tangential accelerations match.
This is because the forces on both are equal (as they are interfacing with each other) and as a result the tangential accelerations have to be the same.
This results in:
$$\alpha_{A}\cdot r_A=\alpha_{B}\cdot r_B$$
