The mechanical work-energy equation is:
$$U_{12}=\int_{s_1}^{s_2}F\cdot ds=\Delta T$$
Using mechanical work and energy we are able to calculate velocities without accelerations.
The calculation only involves forces which do work (i.e. not reaction forces.) and thus contribute to the change in kinetic energy.
The mechanical energy $E$ of a system can be expressed as:
$$E=T+V_g+V_e$$
So the change in mechanical energy is equal to:
$$\Delta E=\Delta(T+V_g+V_e)$$
If there are no externally applied forces $\Delta E=0$, and thus there is a **conservation of mechanical energy**.
#### Gravitational Potential Energy
We can use the change in GPE to describe a system:
$$V_g=mgh$$
$$\Delta V_g=mg(h_2-h_1)=mg\Delta H$$
#### Elastic Potential Energy
The elastic potential energy is also a component of the mechanical energy:
$$ V_e=\frac{1}{2}ku^2$$
$$\Delta V_e=\frac{1}{2}k(u_2^2-u_1^2)$$
