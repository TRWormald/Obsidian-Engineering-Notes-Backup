Objects in motion have internal stresses, even if we assume that they do not deform as a result of them (as we are examining purely rigid bodies.)
A good example of this would be the fan blades in a jet engine which are exposed to extremely high axial loads.
The method for finding these internal stresses is also very similar:
1) Calculate the accelerations of a rigid body
2) Make a cut to expose internal loads
3) Use known accelerations to calculate internal loads/stresses

### Examples
#### Sliding Rod
Consider a rod with mass $m$, length $L$ and cross-sectional area $A$ which rests on a frictionless surface. A force $F$ is applied at distance $d$ from the end.

If we first consider it as a rigid body, the acceleration of the centre of mass is equal to:
$$a=\frac{F}{m}$$
Next if we consider it as a structure, we make a cut at distance $\zeta$ to expose axial loads inside the rod:

Each cut section shares the same acceleration, so we can calculate $P$ using [[Newton's Second Law]]:

Note that we assume that the mass in the rod is uniformly distributed so the mass of a section is equal to the section's length divided by the total length times by the mass.
