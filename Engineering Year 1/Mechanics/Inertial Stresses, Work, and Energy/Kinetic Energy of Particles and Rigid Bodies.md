### Kinetic Energy of Particles
The kinetic energy of a particle can be calculated to be:
$$T=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
The work done by a force $U$ equals the change in kinetic energy:
$$U=T_2-T_1=\Delta T$$
During curvilinear motion (direction and magnitude of force change) the kinetic energy is calculated as follows.
If we consider the applied force $F$ in an intrinsic coordinate system:

The incremental for $dU$ done by the force along the path is equal to:
$$\begin{align*}
dU&=\textbf{F}\cdot d\textbf{r}\\\\
&=|\textbf{F}|cos\beta|d\textbf{r}|\\\\
&=F_t\cdot ds 
\end{align*}$$

So if we integrate along the path:
$$\begin{align*}
U_{12}&=\int_{s_1}^{s_2}F_{t}\cdot ds\\
&= \int_{s_1}^{s_2}ma_t\cdot ds\\
&= \int_{s_1}^{s_2}mv\cdot dv\\
&= \frac{1}{2}m(v_2^2-v_1^2)=\Delta T
\end{align*}$$
### Kinetic Energy of a Rigid Body
For the kinetic energy of a rigid body we have to consider both the translational and rotational components:
$$T=\frac{1}{2}mv_G^2+\frac{1}{2}I_G\omega^2$$
