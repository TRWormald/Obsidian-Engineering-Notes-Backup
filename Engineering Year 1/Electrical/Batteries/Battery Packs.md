Battery packs are when multiple cells are connected together to produce higher voltages and energy storage capacities.
In a battery pack the individual cells are arranged in **series** and **parallel strings**.
In general:
- To calculate the voltage of the battery pack multiply the cells' voltage by the number of cells in series.
- To calculate the electrical charge capacity multiply the cells' electrical charge capacity by the number of parallel strings.

Higher voltage battery packs are ideal as the power lost in a component is related to the current passing through it:
$$P_{loss}=I^{2}R$$
As higher voltage means lower current - according to Ohms Law
