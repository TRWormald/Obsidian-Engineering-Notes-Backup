Batteries store charge and therefore the amount of charge within them can be calculated using the following equation:
$$Q=It$$
Or in other words the amount of charge in a battery is equal to how long it can produce a current of magnitude I.

To calculate the rate of energy extraction from a battery we can use the following equation:
$$\dot{w}_{elec}=I\cdot V$$
Remembering the SOC graph from [[Single Cell Voltage Source]] we know that at higher SOCs the battery has a greater voltage and therefore must extract more power for the same rate of flow.
