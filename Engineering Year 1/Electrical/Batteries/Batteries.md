Batteries are electrochemical devices that store chemical potential energy which can then be converted into electrical energy.
They consist of an anode (negative), a cathode (positive), and an electrolyte.
**Battery** is a catch all term for any electrochemical energy store, a **Cell** refers to a single device, and a **Battery Pack** is made up of one or more individual cells.
Batteries can either be disposable (primary) or rechargeable (secondary) depending on their chemical composition.
