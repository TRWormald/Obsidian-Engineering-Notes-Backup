Using the current divider equation we can find the current in a branch $X$ given the resistance in that branch and the total resistance in the other branches, as well as the input current.
$$I_X=\frac{R_{T}}{R_{X}+R_{T}}\cdot I_{T}$$
\
This comes from the fact that the current in a branch is inversely proportional to the resistance in that branch.
