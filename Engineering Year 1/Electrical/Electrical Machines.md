Electric machines come in a range of different varieties (topologies) all of which achieve a specific thing, typically at the cost of something else.
They all rely on the same basic set of principals - they all exchange energy between mechanical and electric through magnetic fields, either:
- Through the interaction of a current and field (Lorentz force and Faraday's Law)
- Through minimising the energy stored in a magnetic field in air by minimising reluctance (like an electromagnet)

All electric machines have the capability of converting in both directions:
- Mechanical to Electrical - Generator
- Electrical to Mechanical - Motor
