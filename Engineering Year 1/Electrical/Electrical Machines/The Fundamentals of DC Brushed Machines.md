We know that we can use Fleming's left hand rule to determine the direction of the [[Lorentz Force]], and that we can calculate the force using the equation:
$$F=Bil\sin\theta$$
Where $B$ is the magnetic field strength, $i$ is the current, $l$ is the length of wire in the magnetic field, and $\theta$ is the angle between the direction of the current and the magnetic field:

If we have a bundle of $N$ wires carrying $i$ amps then:
$$F=NBil\sin\theta=k_ei\sin\theta,~~~~~~\text{where } k_{e}=BlN $$
