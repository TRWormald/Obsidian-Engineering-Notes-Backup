We know that we can use Fleming's left hand rule to determine the direction of the [[Lorentz Force]], and that we can calculate the force using the equation:
$$F=Bil\sin\theta$$
Where $B$ is the magnetic field strength, $i$ is the current, $l$ is the length of wire in the magnetic field, and $\theta$ is the angle between the direction of the current and the magnetic field:

\
If we have a bundle of $N$ wires carrying $i$ amps then:
$$F=NBil\sin\theta=k_ei\sin\theta,~~~~~~\text{where } k_{e}=BlN $$
We also know that we can calculate the EMF induced in a wire moving through a magnetic field using the equation:
$$\epsilon=B\cdot l\cdot v$$
And can use [[Fleming's Left and Right Hand Rules|Fleming's Right Hand Rule]] rule to determine the direction of the induced current/voltage.
If we apply this to a bundle of $N$ wires moving together at $v$ m/s:
$$\epsilon=BlvN\sin\theta=k_{e}v\sin\theta,~~~~~~\text{where }k_{e}=BlN$$
Where $\theta$ is the angle between the wires and the magnetic field.

**These effects are not isolated, and frequently we get both at the same time.**

1) We apply a voltage to wires in a magnetic field, resulting in a current flowing in them
2) The wires in the magnetic field now experience a force, which results in an acceleration and hence the wires begin to move.
3) This results in an EMF in a direction that opposes the source voltage, and hence the current that caused the movement (back EMF)
4) This reduces the available voltage ($V_S-\epsilon$) for current so the current reduces and the force reduces
5) This reduces the acceleration of the wire
6) As the wire is still accelerating an EMF is still growing
7) At some point the source voltage minus the EMF from the moving wires results in a current that is just enough to overcome the friction force on the wires and the system settles into a steady state.
