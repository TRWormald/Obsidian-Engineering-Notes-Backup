### What is Piezoelectricity?
Piezoelectricity is the process of pressure resulting in a build up of electrical charge.
\
**The Piezoelectric Effect** - Striking a piezoelectric material (applying a force; resulting in mechanical stress) results in a potential difference ($V$) across the material.
**Reverse Piezoelectric Effect** - A potential difference ($V$) across the material results in mechanical deformation.
