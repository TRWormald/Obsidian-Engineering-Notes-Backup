### What is Piezoelectricity?
Piezoelectricity is the process of pressure resulting in a build up of electrical charge.
\
**The Piezoelectric Effect** - Striking a piezoelectric material (applying a force; resulting in mechanical stress) results in a potential difference ($V$) across the material.
**Reverse Piezoelectric Effect** - A potential difference ($V$) across the material results in mechanical deformation.
### Piezoelectric Material Behaviour
Below we can see the result of the application of either the standard piezoelectric effect or the reverse piezoelectric effect:

For the **Piezoelectric Effect** switching the direction of the force in a given dimension results in a reverse in the electrical potential.
For the **Reverse Piezoelectric Effect** switching the direction of the electric potential results in a reverse in mechanical force in a given direction.
\
In the **Piezoelectric Effect** the potential is generated as a result of the centres of charge moving apart (where previously they were in the same position). All piezoelectric materials consist of positively and negatively charged ions (quartz has positive silicon ions and negative oxygen ions):
