### What is Piezoelectricity?
Piezoelectricity is the process of pressure resulting in a build up of electrical charge. It is an electro-mechanical coupling mechanism allowing us to relate potential difference and mechanical force.
\
**The Piezoelectric Effect** - Striking a piezoelectric material (applying a force; resulting in mechanical stress) results in a potential difference ($V$) across the material.
**Reverse Piezoelectric Effect** - A potential difference ($V$) across the material results in mechanical deformation.
### Piezoelectric Material Behaviour
Below we can see the result of the application of either the standard piezoelectric effect or the reverse piezoelectric effect:

For the **Piezoelectric Effect** switching the direction of the force in a given dimension results in a reverse in the electrical potential.
For the **Reverse Piezoelectric Effect** switching the direction of the electric potential results in a reverse in mechanical force in a given direction.
\
In the **Piezoelectric Effect** the potential is generated as a result of the centres of charge moving apart as a result of the applied force (where previously they were in the same position). All piezoelectric materials consist of positively and negatively charged ions (quartz has positive silicon ions and negative oxygen ions):

The above image shows what happens on the atomic scale, and if we zoom out to see the whole of the material:

The reverse occurs in the **Reverse Piezoelectric Effect** with the centres of charges being pulled apart by the potential difference resulting in a mechanical force.
### Using the Piezoelectric Relationship
Understanding the theory is all well and good but how do we apply this, how do we calculate the potential or force generated?
We use the **Piezoelectric Voltage Constant** $g$ to relate the applied (or resultant) force, and the potential difference generated or provided.
\
If we consider this problem dimensionally:
- Electric Field Strength - $N/C$
- Mechanical stress - $N/m^{2}$
Therefore:
- Piezoelectric Voltage Constant - $m^{2}/C$
\
**Typical Values:**
For a single crystal - $20\times 10^{-3}$ to $50\times 10^{-3}~m^{2}/C$
For piezoelectric polymers - $100\times 10^{-3}$ to $300\times 10^{-3}~m^{2}/C$

#### The Piezoelectric Equation
The equation relating the voltage and force is as follows:
$$V=\frac{g\cdot F\cdot t}{A}$$
Where $g$ is the piezoelectric voltage constant, $F$ is the force applied/resultant, $t$ is the thickness of the material, $A$ is the cross sectional area of the material, and $V$ is the potential difference across the material.
