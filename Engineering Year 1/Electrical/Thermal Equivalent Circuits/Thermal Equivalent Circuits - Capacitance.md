We know that all materials possess [[Specific Heat Capacity at Constant Pressure|a specific heat capacity]] which defines the temperature rise in a unit mass of material as a consequence of heat energy addition.

Consider the steady state condition of an object before and after the addition of heat energy. The mass $m$ is constant as is the specific heat capacity $c_{p}$. The temperature of the object rises from $T_{1}$ to $T_{2}$, so $\Delta T=T_{2}-T_{1}$. Hence:
$$Q=m\cdot c_{p}\cdot(T_{2}-T_{1})$$
As the mass and specific heat capacity are constant we can combine them into a single homogenous unit - the thermal capacitance $C_{t}$ where:
$$C_{t}=m\cdot c_{p}$$
Hence:
$$Q=C_{t}\cdot (T_{2}-T_{1})$$
