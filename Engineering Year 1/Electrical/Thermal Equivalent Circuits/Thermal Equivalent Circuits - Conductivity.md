### Thermal System
#### Intro to Concepts
All materials have a [[Thermal Conductivity]] which defines the rate at which heat will pass through the material.
\
Heat conduction will always be driven by a temperature gradient - heat energy cannot move against a temperature gradient. Heat conduction rate is a function of:
- Temperature Gradient
- Distance of Conduction
- Surface area of plane normal to the direction of heat transfer
- Thermal Conductivity
Such that:
$$\dot{Q}=\frac{k\cdot A\cdot\Delta T}{\Delta x}$$
We will assume that properties are constants for a given material sample, so the only thing that can affect $\dot{Q}$ is $\Delta T$.
### Thermal System
As all of our properties are constant we can combine them to get a new property, the thermal resistance $R_{t}$:
$$R_{t}=\frac{\Delta x}{k\cdot A}$$
So:
$$\dot{Q}]$$
