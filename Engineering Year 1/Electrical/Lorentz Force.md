When a charged particle moves through a magnetic field with a velocity it experiences a force. This often manifests as an interaction between a current carrying conductor and a magnet.
The Lorentz force is a force on a moving **positive** charge (the direction of the force is reversed for a negative charge).
$$\vec{F}=q(\vec{v}\times\vec{B})$$
Where $\vec{F}$ is the Lorentz force, $q$ is the charge, $\vec{v}$ is the charge velocity, and $\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field density.
$\vec{F}$ is maximised when $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{B}$ are orthogonal, and the force is zero when they are parallel.
Applying the cross product we know that:
$$F=q(|v|\cdot|B|)sin\theta$$
Where $\theta$ is the angle between $v$ and $B$.
\
For a current carrying wire the force applied to it is:
$$F=B\cdot I\cdot l$$
Where $I$ is the current in the wire, and $l$ is the length of wire in the magnetic field.
We can use the right hand rule to determine the direction of the force.
