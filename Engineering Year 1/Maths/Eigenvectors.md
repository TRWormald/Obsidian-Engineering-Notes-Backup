An **eigenvector** of a $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is a nonzero vector $\vec{x}$ such that:
$$A\vec{x}=\lambda\vec{x}$$
For some scalar $\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is called an **eigenvalue** of $A$.
Hence, an eigenvector is a vector transformation, which when applied to a matrix, creates a scaled version of itself.
