Given a second order linear homogeneous ODE in the form:
$$\ddot{x}+\beta^2x=0$$
where $\beta$ is a real constant, we find that:
- [[The Characteristic Polynomial]] has pure imaginary roots $\lambda= \pm\beta j$
- The general solution can be written in multiple equivalent ways:
$$x(t)=Ae^{\beta jt}+Be^{-\beta jt}=C~sin(\beta t)+D~cos(\beta t)= E~cos(\beta t-F)$$
With the first being the 'exponential form' the second being the 'trigonometric form' and the third being the 'amplitude-phase form'
