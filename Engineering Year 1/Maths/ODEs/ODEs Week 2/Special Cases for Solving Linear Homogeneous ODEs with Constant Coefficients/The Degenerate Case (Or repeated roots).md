For a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients $a\ddot{x}+b\dot{x}+cx=0$. If the discriminant $b^2-4ac=0$, then:
- The characteristic polynomial  has a real repeated root $\lambda=-\frac{b}{2a}$
- The general solution takes the form:
$$x(t)=Ae^{\lambda t}+Bte^{\lambda t},~~~ where~\lambda=-\frac{b}{2a}$$
\
Note that if a root is repeated more than twice you just keep on iterating, for example for a triple repeated root the general solution would be:
$$x(t)=Ae^{\lambda t}+Bte^{\lambda t}+Ct^2e^{\lambda t},~~~ where~\lambda=-\frac{b}{2a}$$
