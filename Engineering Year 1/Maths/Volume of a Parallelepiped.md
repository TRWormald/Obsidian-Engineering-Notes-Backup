The volume of a parallelepiped is given by the formula:
$$\text{Volume}=|\vec{c}\cdot(\vec{a}\times \vec{b})|$$
Where the vectors above correspond to those on the diagram below:

This is derived from the fact that the definition of the cross product is:
$$\vec{a}\times\vec{b}=|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\sin(\theta) \hat{n}$$
The area of a triangle with two sides and the angle between them is:
$$\frac{1}{2}ab\sin\theta$$
So the area of the base of the parallelepiped is twice that (or equal to the cross product). And then taking the dot product of that vector with the final side of the shape gives the volume as:
$$\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\cos\phi$$
So we are multiplying the base area by the component of $\vec{c}$ in the direction of $\vec{a}\times\vec{b}$ hence getting the volume.
