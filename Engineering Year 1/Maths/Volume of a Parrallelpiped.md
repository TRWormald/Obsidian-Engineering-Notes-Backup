The volume of a parallelepiped is given by the formula:
$$\text{Volume}=|\vec{c}\cdot(\vec{a}\times \vec{b})|$$
Where the vectors above correspond to those on the diagram below:

This is derived from the fact that the definition of the cross product is:
$$\vec{a}\times\vec{b}=|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\sin(\theta) \hat{n}$$
The area of a triangle with two sides and the angle between them is:
$$\frac{1}{2}ab$$
