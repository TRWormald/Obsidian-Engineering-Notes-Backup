### Mean
The mean is the average value of the data, it is calculated in the following way:
$$\text{Mean}=\mu=\frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}x_i$$
Where $N$ is the number of data points.
### Standard Deviation
Standard deviation is a measure of how the data varies around the mean, with a larger standard deviation representing a greater spread of values.
It is calculated in the following way:
$$\text{Standard Deviation}=\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}x^{2}_{i}}{N}-\left(\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}}{N}\right)^{2}}$$
