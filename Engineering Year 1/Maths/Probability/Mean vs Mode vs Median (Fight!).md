The mean of a distribution is its "strict average" and it is $\mu$ or $E(X)$.
\
The mode (the most common value) is where $\frac{df_{X}}{dx}=0$ and is a local maximum.
\
The median value $m$ is the middle value, such that $P(x<m)=0.5$
\
This relationship can be seen on the diagram below:

The red line is $f_X(x)$ - the Probability Density Function
Note how the modal value occurs at the turning point of the curve.
