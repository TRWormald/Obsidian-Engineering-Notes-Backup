## Continuous Probability Distributions
Sometimes we want to map the probability of **continuous events** (where the sample space is continuous - and doesn't take discrete values).
The probability in these cases will always be an inequality as the probability of something being exactly a single value is zero (for example no-one is exactly 2m tall).
