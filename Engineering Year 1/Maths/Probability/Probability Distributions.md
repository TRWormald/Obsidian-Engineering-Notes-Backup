## Continuous Probability Distributions
Sometimes we want to map the probability of **continuous events** (where the sample space is continuous - and doesn't take discrete values).
The probability in these cases will always be an inequality as the probability of something being exactly a single value is zero (for example no-one is exactly 2m tall).
### The Normal Distribution
The normal distribution is a very common probability distribution that turns up literally everywhere. It is defined by the [[Mean and Standard Deviation]] of the data and is characterised by the fact that the mean median and mode all fall at the same value:

The distribution is symmetric (so 50% of data is below the mean and 50% is greater than the mean) and specific amounts of the data lies within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean:

The equation for the normal distribution is:
$$f_{X}(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{[- \frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}]}$$
