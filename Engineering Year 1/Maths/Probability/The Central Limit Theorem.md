The central limit theorem is as follows:
*Given any sequence of random variables $X_i$ where $i=1,2,3,...,n$ that describe **independent** events with **identical** distributions with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$*.
*Then in the limit $n\rightarrow\infty$, their sum $X_{1}+X_{2}+...+X_{n}$ is approximately equal to $N(n\mu,n\sigma^{2})$*.
*That is the sum tends to a normal distribution with mean $n\mu$ and variance $n\sigma^{2}$*.
\
This means that the normal distribution using the data's mean and variance represents the probability of the mean being in a given range.
