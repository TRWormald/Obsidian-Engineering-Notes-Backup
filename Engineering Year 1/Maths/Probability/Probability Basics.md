Probability theory measures the chance of a random **event** happening.
\
For each **event** we have to consider the sample space $S$ - this is the set of **all possible outcomes**; ultimately events are a subset of the sample space.
\
Often we can represent sets on a Venn diagram!
#### Common Notation
This is an **or** symbol $\cup$ it is used when you want the areas of two sets combined:
$$P(A\cup B)\text{ is the probability of A or B happening}$$
This is an **and** symbol $\cap$ it is used when you want the intersection of two sets:
$$P(A\cap B)\text{ is the probability of A and B happening}$$
When a set has a bar over the top $\bar{x}$ it means **not**, so in this case $\bar{x}=1-x$.
#### Independence and Mutual Exclusivity
##### Idependance
If two (or more) events are independent then they do not effect each other in any way, an example of this would be tossing a coin - it coming up heads the first time has no impact on what it will come up the next time/
