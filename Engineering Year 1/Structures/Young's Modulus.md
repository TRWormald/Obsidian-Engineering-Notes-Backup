Young's modulus is a property representing a given material's stiffness.
$$E=\frac{Fl}{Ax}$$
Where:
- $E$ is the Young's Modulus, measured in Pa
- $F$ is the applied force, measured in N
- $l$ is the original length of the material, measured in m
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the material, measured in $\text{m}^2$ 
- $x$ is the increase in length due to the applied force, this is measured in m

Note that the technical definition of young's modulus is:
$$E=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}$$
Where $\sigma$ is the stress in the material (Pa) and $\epsilon$ is the strain (dimensionless).
