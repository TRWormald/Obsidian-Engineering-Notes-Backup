By taking cuts in beams we can calculate the Shear Forces and Bending Moments in them.
The shear force is an internal force on the beam which keeps it in equilibrium.
The bending moment is a moment that exists within the mean which keeps it in moment equilibrium.

Take the following example:

If we make a cut at 5m away from A:

As we no longer have the reaction force from support B there must be another force (the shear force) which keeps the system in vertical force equilibrium.
So, $5-10-F=0$ hence $F=-5kN$ (in other words it is pointing upwards as we initially had it as pointing down)
If we consider the other half of the beam:
![[Pasted image 20240226112700.png#center|]]
We see that the shear force on this side is equal but opposite (as it is pointing down). We take [[The Sign Convention for Shear Force and Bending Moment in Beams]] so this section is experiencing negative shear forces, the same as the first section.
\
However shear forces alone are not enough to describe the equilibrium of the beam, this is because they don't provide a sufficient moment to keep the section in moment equilibrium:

If we take our first example there are clockwise moments equal to $30kN$ created by the load about A, compared with only $25kN$ created by the shear force. As a result we have to include a 'Bending Moment' of $5kN$ anti-clockwise to keep the beam in equilibrium.
This bending moment is created by a tensile and compressive forces in the beam (See [[Longitudinal Stresses in Beams]])
