### Choice of Propulsion System
Why do we choose specific systems? We design for specific fuel consumption (i.e. fuel flow per unit thrust):

### Thermodynamics?
Thermodynamics is important to the study of Gas turbines as it is the "interrelationship and the conversion of different forms of energy". And a gas turbine is fundamentally an energy converter (changing primarily chemical into thermal, and then kinetic energy).
### The Brayton Cycle for a Gas Turbine

The Brayton cycle is a simple thermodynamic cycle where energy is constantly generated. It consists of four stages:
- Isentropic compression (1-2)
- Isobaric heat addition $Q_{in}$ (2-3)
- Isentropic expansion (3-4)
- Isobaric heat rejection $Q_{out}$ (4-1)
