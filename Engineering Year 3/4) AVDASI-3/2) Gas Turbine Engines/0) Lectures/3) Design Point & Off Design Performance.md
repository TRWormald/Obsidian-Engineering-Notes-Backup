>**The Design Point**
>This is where all components are matched at their Design Conditions - often where each unit achieves design pressure ratio and peak efficiency at maximum flow. This is also sometimes called the Synthesis Matching Point.

The altitude and Mach number conditions are usually those which are critical for the Aircraft/Engine Requirements. Typically (for a passenger airliner) the design point will be at the top of climb - 35,000ft M=0.7-0.8. This will differ from a military aircraft however.

All other conditions are Off-Design where the pressure ratio, efficiency, and flow are different from those at the design point.

### By-pass Engines
The majority of "Jet" engines are by-pass engines - meaning that air driven by the fan is moved along the outside of the core.

#### Different By-pass Ratios for Different Aircraft
![[Pasted image 20260203103422.png|centre|500]]
Typically airliners and civilian aircraft have high by-pass turbofans as they are more efficient, however since they produce less thrust they are not as useful for military aircraft. Low by-pass ratio engines are therefore often used by military aircraft for that reason - although a number of early jet-liners used low-by-pass/turbojet engines due to technological constraints.

### The Cycle Design Point: Main Parameters
#### Turbofan Engine
The main parameters to consider are:
- Overall Pressure Ratio - The total pressure at the compressor delivery divided by that at entry to the first compressor stage
- Stator Outlet Temperature - The temperature of gas which does work at the first turbine rotor - this is also sometimes called the Rotor Inlet or Turbine Inlet Temperature
- Fan Pressure Ratio - The total pressure at fan delivery divided by that fan at entry
- By-pass Ratio - The ratio of mass flow of the by-pass stream to that passing through the combustion system.
- Component Performance Parameters - The characteristics of each component in terms of efficiency, flow capacity, pressure, etc.
- Pressure Balance in Exhaust Jets - The ratio of the static pressure in the two streams should be close to unity.
### Intake Performance
The intake can be considered an **Adiabatic Duct** with no heat or work transfer - i.e. the Total Temperature remains constant. The losses due to friction, shocks, etc. will be seen as a reduction in the total pressure.

The main ways of defining Intake Performance are:
- Inlet Pressure Ratio Factor (defined as the reduction in stagnation pressure in the inlet)
- Ram Efficiency (defined in terms of pressure)
- Isentropic Efficiency (defined in terms of temperature)

#### Intake Efficiency
##### In Terms of Pressure
**Intake Pressure Ratio Factor**:
Intake performance is usually quoted in terms of a pressure recovery factor $\frac{p_{01}}{p_{0a}}$ i.e. the reduction stagnation pressure in the inlet.

**Ram Efficiency:**
$$\eta_{r}=\frac{P_{01}-P_{a}}{P_{oa}-P_{a}}$$
##### Isentropic

### Thrust Augmentation
It is possible to augment the thrust produced using systems like afterburners:
![[Pasted image 20260203104623.png|centre]]
### Nozzle Performance
We can express the Net Thrust as:
$$\text{\textbf{Net Thrust} = Nozzle Gross Thrust - Momentum Drag}$$
Where the Nozzle Gross Thrust is:
$$F_{N_{gross}}=\dot{m}_{j}\cdot C_{j}+A_{j}\cdot(P_{j}-P_{a})$$
For a convergent-divergent or an un-choked convergent nozzle, the static pressure at the nozzle exit is equal to the ambient static pressure i.e. $P_{j}=P_{a}$. Hence the pressure term is zero.

The Ideal Gross Thrust is  assuming that the flow entering the nozzle is expanded adiabatically and reversibly to the ambient static pressure i.e. a convergent-divergent nozzle with no losses.

#### Supersonic High-bypass Ratio Engines
It is possible to have either mixed jets or separate jets coming out of an engine:

The image on the right shows a typical practical mixer of the two.
#### Mixing of the Hot and Cold Streams

### Mechanical Design Parameters
There are a number of design parameters that need to be addressed/kept within limits when designing a jet engine:
- Shaft Speeds
- Compressor delivery temperature and pressure
- Fan flutter
- Vibration levels of rotating components
- Disc and blade stress levels
- Cycling and creep life of major components
- Oxidation levels of components
- Rotating flow instabilities
