>**The Design Point**
>This is where all components are matched at their Design Conditions - often where each unit achieves design pressure ratio and peak efficiency at maximum flow. This is also sometimes called the Synthesis Matching Point.

The altitude and Mach number conditions are usually those which are critical for the Aircraft/Engine Requirements. Typically (for a passenger airliner) the design point will be at the top of climb - 35,000ft M=0.7-0.8. This will differ from a military aircraft however.

All other conditions are Off-Design where the pressure ratio, efficiency, and flow are different from those at the design point.

### By-pass Engines
The majority of "Jet" engines are by-pass engines - meaning that air driven by the fan is moved along the outside of the core.

#### Different By-pass Ratios for Different Aircraft

Typically airliners and civilian aircraft have high by-pass turbofans as they are more efficient, however since they produce less thrust they are not as useful for military aircraft. Low by-pass ratio engines ar
