The analysis of propellers is typically done using a combination of:
- Momentum Theory & Blade Element Analysis
- Vortex Lifting Line Theory & Blade Element Analysis

### Momentum Theory
#### Actuator Disc Theory
We have previously covered this in Aero 2. However that was primarily focused on rotorcraft with blades optimised for hover, now we will be focusing on propellers for thrust.
