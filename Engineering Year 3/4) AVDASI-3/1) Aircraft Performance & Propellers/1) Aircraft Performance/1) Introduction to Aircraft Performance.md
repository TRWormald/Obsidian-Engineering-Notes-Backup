>Unit Learning Objectives:
>1) Discuss design considerations and describe essential features of aircraft propulsion systems
>2) Perform calculations on aircraft propulsion systems, **and fixed/rotary wing aircraft performance**
>3) Evaluate implications of various economic, environmental, and other operational considerations

The objectives of the APP (Performance) section of this unit is to:
- Advance understanding of general aircraft performance, from what was covered in Y1
- Explore the aircraft performance, using dedicated modelling methods for fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft.

### What is aircraft performance?
The performance of an aircraft is a statement of its capabilities & it is measured for specific design missions.

The performance is stated in quantities such as:
- Direct Operating Cost (DOC)
- Maximum range
- Cruising speed, manoeuvrability, altitude ceiling
- Airport requirements for landing/take off
- Aircraft noise and emissions
- Engine failure performance

### Why do we need to evaluate aircraft performance?
- Design of new aircraft
- Select a new aircraft
- Verify that the aircraft achieves its design targets
- Efficiently operate an existing aircraft or fleet
- Modify, upgrade and extend the flight envelope
- Upgrade and extend the mission profile
- Investigate the cause of aircraft accidents
- Provide data for aircraft certification
- Environmental analysis on the ground and in-flight
