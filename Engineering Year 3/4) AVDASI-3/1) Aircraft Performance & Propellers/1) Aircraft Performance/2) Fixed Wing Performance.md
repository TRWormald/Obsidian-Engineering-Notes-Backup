What is the simplest way to express an aircraft's performance?
We can consider the forces acting on the aircraft (lift & weight, thrust & drag) and therefore the amounts required:

Weight => Lift => Drag => Thrust => Fuel Consumption => Weight

Each drives the other in turn, for a given set of operating conditions.

Therefore the data we need for an aircraft performance calculation is:
1) The mission definition (Operating conditions, range, take off and landing requirements)
2) Mass (Payload, fuel load, operator's mass empty, maximum take off mass)
3) Drag Data (Zero lift, Induced, Wave, Reynolds Drag)
4) Engine Data (Thrust, and fuel flow across the flight envelope)

#### Wing Loading & Wing Sweep
Wing loadings (at take-off mass) for a new design should be in the range 600-650 kg/m^2, with derivative versions potentially having higher wing loading.
The wing loading is generally set by cruise performance and take of and landing requirements, as well as the type of flaps employed.

The wing sweep is largely set by cruise speed:

#### Cruise Speed and Lift Coefficient
At typical start of cruise conditions:
Altitude 35000ft
Cruise Mach No
Mass ~97% of Take off Mass

The C_L needs to be within the buffet boundary (i.e. the beginnings of wing stall)

#### Drag Characteristics
$$\underbrace{C_{D_{tot}}}_\text{Total Drag Coefficient}=C_{D_{0}}+KC_{L}^{2}+\underbrace{\Delta C_{D_{W}}}_\text{Increment in drag due to wave drag}+\underbrace{\Delta C_{D_{Re}}}_\text{Increment in drag due to difference in Re}$$
