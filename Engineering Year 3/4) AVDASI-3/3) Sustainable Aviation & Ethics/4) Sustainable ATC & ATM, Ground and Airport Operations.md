**Possible Sustainability Measures**
- Greener flight paths
- Greener airlines operations & practices
- Greener taxiing & ground operations

### Classic Flight Profile

Flight Profiles are inefficient - have acceleration and decelerations resulting in burning more fuel.

### Air Traffic Management
![[Pasted image 20260212130715.png|centre]]
Commercial airliners operate under IFR. Take Off and Landing: Sequenced & Controlled by ATC.

### Greener Flight Paths
- Performance Based Navigation (PBN)
- Free Route Airspace (FRA) -> Optimal flight route based on wind vector field
- More sensors, MSDF, onboard data processing, etc.
- Hybrid ATM
Other methods:
- Continuous climb (to reach thin air) & cruise climb (as aircraft loses fuel weight)
- Continuous descent and avoidance of sequencing loiter
- Avoid altitudes to prevent contrails

### The Effect of Long Haul Flights

Long haul flights produce disproportionate amount of CO2 compared to the number of flights classified as "long haul".
