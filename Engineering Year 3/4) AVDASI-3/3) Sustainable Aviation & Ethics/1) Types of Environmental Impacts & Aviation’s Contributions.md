How bad is aviation for the environment:
- Contributes 2.5% of global CO2 emissions
- It also has non CO2 effects
- The fuel consumption/passenger/km is now almost equivalent to road travel
	- However the number of km flown approximately doubles every 15 years

There is more air traffic at high altitudes and in the northern hemisphere, aircraft exhausts produce various chemical compounds which contribute to global warming and reduce air quality.

Aircraft contrails reflect sunlight during the day, but trap it during the day and at night.

Efforts are being made to make the industry net zero. The responsibility for this falls to the aviation industry as a whole - but design plays a major part in reducing emissions and making aircraft more efficient.
