### Control Surfaces
Before considering how to represent the variations in aerodynamic force and moment in the equations of motion (which depend on the aircraft geometry and its operating envelope), we consider the physical means by which the aircraft can be controlled/manoeuvred.
This is most commonly achieved through aerodynamic means, using control surfaces.
