Following the trimming and linearisation of the aircraft and observing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system we can observe the "modes" of the aircraft.

There are five primary modes in dynamic flight:
**Aircraft Modes - Longitudinal** (Phugoid & Short-Period)
**Aircraft Modes - Lateral-Directional** (Roll Subsidence, Dutch Roll, and Spiral)
### Longitudinal Modes
There are two complex conjugate pairs. One is low frequency and low damping ratio (the Phugoid) and can even be unstable (i.e. $\sigma$ is positive). The short-period pair is higher frequency and much more heavily damped. typically $\sigma$ is much more negative.
#### The short-period mode
The disturbance velocity in the transverse direction $w$ helps to define the total incidence during the disturbance because of $\Delta\alpha=w/U$
Thus, whatever steady flight incidence there has been, a transverse disturbance of $w$ will alter it, and the longitudinal balance of forces will be lost.
Similarly, a disturbance of the pitch balance will lead to pitching action and a pitch rate $q$. These two disturbances cause the wing and its tail lifts to depart from the trimmed values and thus the consequent short-period mode is essentially a seeking of that trimmed state again. It does not take long to achieve and is generally quite heavily damped.

The short period motion is thus composed of largely $w$ and $q$ with virtually no change in forward speed.
A typical period would be 1-4 seconds.
