The micromechanics of composite strength are more complex; there are various mechanisms for composite laminate failure:
- Fibre fracture
- Matrix micro-cracking
- Debonding
- Delamination

The aim is to qualitatively describe failure modes for different loading.

### Longitudinal Tensile Strength ($X_{t}$)
The longitudinal tensile strength is found using the rule of mixtures:
$$\huge{\boxed{X_{t}=\sigma_{f_{max}}V_{f}+(\sigma_{m})_{\varepsilon_{f_{max}}}(1-V_{f}) }}$$
Where $(\sigma_{m})_{\varepsilon_{f_{max}}}$ is the matrix stress at maximum tensile strain in the fibres.
This assumes that:
- The matrix has higher strain to failure than the fibres
- All fibres have the same strength and fail simultaneously.

The strength of an individual fibre dis dominated by defects, the strength $\sigma$ is described by the Weibull probability distribution:
$$p(\sigma)=1-e^{-\left(\frac{L}{L_{0}}\right)\left(\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_{0}}\right)^{m}}$$
With fibre length $L$, characteristic fibre strength $\sigma_{0}$ for length $L_{0}$. This means that the loner our fibres, the higher the defect probability and hence the lower the strength.

In a composite material the matrix redistributes load around fibre fracture, similar to load transfer for short-fibre composites. Fractured fibre continues to carry load, so the composite is stronger than the characteristic fibre strength.

### Longitudinal Compressive Strength ($X_{c}$)
There are several failure modes when under compressive loads:

### Transverse Strength ($Y_{t},Y_{c}$)
The transverse tensile $Y_{t}$ strength failure mechanisms are:
- Strain concentrations around fibres
- Matrix micro-cracks
Note that strain concentrations increase for higher $V_{f}$ and $E_{f}$.
The transverse compressive $Y_{c}$ strength failure mechanisms are:
- Matrix Shear
- Debonding
