>**Composite Materials**
>Composed of at least two materials, which combine to achieve enhanced properties and functionality

In Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites, there is:
- Fibre Reinforcement - provides stiffness and strength
- Polymer Matrix - transfers load between fibres, provides toughness, and protects fibres
