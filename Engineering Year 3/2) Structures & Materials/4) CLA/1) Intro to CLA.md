In Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites, there is:
- Fibre Reinforcement - provides stiffness and strength
- Polymer Matrix - transfers load between fibres, provides toughness, and protects fibres

The advantages of using fibres in composites (and in general) is that it is very easy to identify whether there is material defects in them, as in the event of a fibre being compromised it will not stand up to any level of scrutiny. Think about the reasons for the use of wire-wound vs built up guns.

Common types of fibres used in FRP are:
- Carbon
- Glass
- Aramid
- Natural Fibres (like flax, or cactus!)

The matrix is typically some kind of polymer with a low stiffness (~5 GPa).

Laminates are composed of multiple plies of composite. These can be oriented in different directions to provide axial strength in the desired directions. i.e. composites can be tailored to a specific situation based on load requirements.
