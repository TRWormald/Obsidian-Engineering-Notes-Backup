The first step to calculating the properties of a finite element is to suppose that the internal displacements $u$ are expressed in terms of discrete nodal variables through the matrix relation:
$$\mathbf{u=Nd}$$
Where $\mathbf{N}$ is a matrix of shape functions that account for the deformed configuration of the element as a function of the nodal parameters, $\mathbf{d}$.
