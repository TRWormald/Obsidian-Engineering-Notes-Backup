### Strong Form vs Weak Form
The *strong form* is where the solution must satisfy the PDE and boundary conditions at exactly every point within the domain.
The governing equations are in their original differential form, and the solution needs to be sufficiently smooth, typically requiring high levels of continuity and differentiability.

The *weak form* is derived by multiplying PDEs by a test function, and integrating, reducing the differentiability requirements. 
It relaxes the pointwise conditions, focusing on satisfying the equation in an "average" sense across the domain.
