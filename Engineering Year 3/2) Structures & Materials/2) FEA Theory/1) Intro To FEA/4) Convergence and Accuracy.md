The accuracy of the finite element model improves as the size of the elements used in the discretisation decreases.
As well-formulated finite elements become smaller, the solution converges asymptotically and monotonically to that of the real, continuous, structure.
As the order of the shape functions, i.e. the number of degrees of freedom characterising the behaviour of each element, increases, the solution becomes more accurate.
The trade-off between computational cost and solution accuracy can be controlled by adjusting the discretisation.
