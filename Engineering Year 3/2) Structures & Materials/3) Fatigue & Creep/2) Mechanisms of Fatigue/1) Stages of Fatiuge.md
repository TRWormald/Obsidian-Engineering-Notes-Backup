Fatigue failure stress is much lower than the static strength, the fracture initiates at the surface; the stress concentrations form due to stress raisers.
Damage accumulation stages:
- Stage 1 - Crack Initiation
Safe life design of safety critical or less inspectable structures - crack free life assuming no initial micro crack
- Stage 2 - Slow Propagation of Crack
Fail safe design of easily inspectable structures (e.g. fuselage skin/empennage) - assuming initial micro-crack
- Stage 3 - Fast Propagation of Crack
### Stage 1 - Crack Initiation
