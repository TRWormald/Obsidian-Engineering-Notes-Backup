### Definitions and Load Cycles
> **Fatigue**
> This is the response to cyclic loads. It is defined by loading *below the elastic limit*. This results in the accumulation of microscopic damage leading to catastrophic failure.

There are a number of different kinds of load cycles that contribute to fatigue:
- Constant amplitude cycles
	- Completely reversed cycle $|S_{max}|=|S_{min}|,~~S_{m}=0$
	- Non-zero mean stress/partly reversed cycle $S_{m}\ne0$
	- Tension-tension cycle $S_{min}>0$
- Variable amplitude cycle
	- Constant mean stress cycle
	- Variable mean stress cycle

### Material Level Fatigue Tests
We can test material fatigue using a number of different tests:
- Axial loading fatigue tests (alternating between tension and compression)

- Rotating beam fatigue test (allowing you to test the bending response at all angles)

For a *constant amplitude completely reversed cycle*:
$$S_{max}=M\cdot \frac{y}{I}=P\cdot L\cdot  \frac{y}{I}=P\cdot L\cdot \frac{d/2}{\frac{\pi}{64}d}$$
