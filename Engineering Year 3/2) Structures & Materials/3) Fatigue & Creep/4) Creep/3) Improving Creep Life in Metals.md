### Low Temperature Creep (Slip)
More effective barriers to dislocation movements results in strengthening. This can involve:
- Solid solution hardening
- Precipitation hardening
- Dispersion hardening (which is better than precipitation hardening as the particles don't dissolve at high temperatures)
We can also increase strength by slowing down the recovery process, which can be achieved through:
- minimising self diffusion
- Using closed packed structures (FCC,HCP)

### Intermediate Temperature Creep (Slip + Grain Boundary Sliding)
We can still use all the methods of strengthening against low temperature creep. However we can also use:
- Directional solidification 
	- Align grains such that no tensile component is perpendicular to the grain boundaries
	- Meaning that micro-voids cant grow
- Grain coarsening
	- Ideally things are made of a single crystal to eliminate defects

### High temperature Creep (Slip + GBS + Vacancy Migration)
Again we can still use all of the methods mentioned before, but we can also:
- Seal the grain boundaries
	- This can be done using small atoms like Beryllium and Zirconium
	- Which migrate to grain boundaries and stop vacancy migration to grain boundaries.
	- Inconel ?
