The primary mechanisms for creep in metals are:
1) Twinning
2) Slip
3) Grain Boundary Sliding
4) Vacancy Migration

### Low Temperature Creep (0.3-0.6 Tm)
Slip is the main deformation mechanism
Work hardening prevents the material  deforming at constant stress, since interactions between dislocations cancel/lock/repel/annihilate each other.
Piled up/locked dislocations can move from their stress fields by following RECOVERY PROCESSES (diffusion controlled movement of atoms at relatively higher temperatures):
- Climb
- Cross slip

### Intermediate Temperature Creep (0.6-0.8 Tm)
Slip coupled with boundary later sliding are the primary mechanisms.
An accumulation of dislocations cause O type voids along grain boundaries. Even small grain boundary movement can cause micro-voids at triple points.
The coalescence of these voids leads to failure.
Intermediate creep fractures are typically intergranular.

### High Temperature Creep (>0.8 Tm)
Slip and grain boundary sliding coupled with vacancy migration.
Vacancy migration helps faster void formation at grain boundaries.
