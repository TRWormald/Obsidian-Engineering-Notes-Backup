>Creep is the time dependent deformation of a material at a constant stress and temperature (typically at a higher temperature)

As we increase the temperature or stress there is an affect on the creep rate:

In an aerospace context it is important to understand creep in:
- Gas turbine blades
- Hot components in jet engines & rocket motors
- Supersonic airframes
- Rivets and bolts near hot zones
- Tools/dies for hot forging
