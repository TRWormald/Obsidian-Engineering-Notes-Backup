### Manifestations of Creep Failure
- Excessive deformation (Design failure)
- Excessive Deformation leading to instability/loss of functionality (Functionality Compromise)
- Rupture/Fracture (Catastrophic)

### Creep Design Data - Short Term ($t_{c}<10^{4}$ hrs)
Option 1 - Creep Test
Option 2 - Stress Rupture Test
	No strain measurement allowing quicker tests
	Creep strength = Stress which gives 1000 hrs of rupture life at a given temperature
Option 3 - Larson-Miller Parameter
$$LMP_{\sigma}=(T+273.15)(C+\log t_{R})$$
Where C is typically 20.

### Creep Design Data - Long Term ($t_{c}>10^{4}$ hrs)
Option 1 - Design based on minimum creep rate
	Design life: as per requirement
	Allowable strain: designers choice of material allowable and margin
	Allowable strain rate: allowable strain/design life
	Carry out creep test at design stress and temperature
	Ensure that the strain rate is lower than the allowable strain rate.
Option 2 - Design based on accelerated creep test
	Creep life predicted through empirical relations
	We then either, mechanically, thermally, or thermo-mechanically accelerate the test to reduce the time it takes.
