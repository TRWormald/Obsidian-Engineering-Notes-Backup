### Airframe Design Philosophies
**Safe Lift, Fail Safe & Damage Tolerant**
These are the primary design philosophies in aircraft design.
They can sometimes be called "Safety By Retirement", "Safety By Design", and "Safety By Inspection".
#### Safe Life Design
The safe life is the number of flights/landings/flight hours, during which there is a low probablility that the strength will degrade below design strength.
The design criteria are:
- Safety by retirement
- Fatigue failure not likely to occur during the design life
- Safe-life interval = projected lifepan fo the aircraft = crack free service life.
#### Fail Safe Design
Designed NOT to fail
There are three cases:
1) Infinite life
2) Redundant load paths
3) Residual strength-based design
Design criteria:
- Max stress < FEL (fatigue crack propagation stage)
- Multiple redundant spars in the wing
- Compression after impact (CAI) as design allowable for very conservative design

This is generally economical and safe than safe life.

#### Damage Tolerant Design
Designed with maintenance (detection capability & inspection schedule) in the loop (current). The aircraft are designed assuming the presence of damage, and that they can sustain loads until a critical size of the damage. It is assumed that defects can be detected until they attain the critical design through inspection protocol, and repairs should restore the original strength.

#### The Safety Design Approach

#### FHA/FMEA/FMECA
These are structured engineering practice to analyse potential causes of operational failure.
### Materials & Manufacturing
### Operational Environments
Apply knock down factors repeatedly to obtain the actual strength of the material you can use in your design calculations.
