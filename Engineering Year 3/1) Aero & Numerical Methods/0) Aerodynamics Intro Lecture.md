There are two primary sections in this unit:
1) Numerical Methods (Rendall)
2) Aerodynamics (Nicolai)
The former covers: Discretisation, Solution Strategies, Meshing, and Hardware Specific Numerical Methods' Details
The latter covers: Laminar and Turbulent Boundary Layers, General Integral Boundary Layer Methods, Transition, and Separation.

There are 5 sessions per week (4 lectures & 1 Q&A)
There is an assessed computational exercise (starting week 5) - we will need to apply boundary layer methods, coupled to a full potential model (ESDU VGK), alongside usage of an in-house Euler (inviscid) code, and a commercial CFD tool (Star-CCM+).
There will be two computer lab drop in sessions.
**Will be assessed via one question on the final exam.**

There will be individual learning activities, typically one per week (MATLAB app, example question, online video, etc.)
