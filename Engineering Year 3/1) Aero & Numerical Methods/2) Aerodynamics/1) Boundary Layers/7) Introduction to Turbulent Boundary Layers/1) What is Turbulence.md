Turbulence is complex, it involves:
- Random fluctuations
- "Random" motion
- And many scales of interactions
In turbulent flows there are rapid fluctuations locally even in steady flows. It could even be said that it is the last great scientific challenge in aerodynamics. Fully resolving turbulence with CFD at realistic Re is unlikely - so the challenge may be more to do with dealing with the uncertainty rather than removing it.
### What causes turbulence?
Turbulence is caused by the presence of **turbulent eddies** in the flow:

Fortunately these are cohesive and occur when inertial forces dominate viscous dissipation, i.e. high Reynolds numbers. We will return to [[1) What is Transition|transition]] later.
### Turbulence
Attached flows may have laminar or turbulent boundary layers. Usually, aircraft operate with attached flows and turbulent boundary layers. Flow separation is separate, but it does also result in large scale turbulence. However, turbulence dies not imply separation.
Turbulence has a very wide range of time and length scales which makes it challenging to resolve. Atmospheric turbulence may consist of large roughly uniform air currents while wake turbulence consists of clearly identifiable vortices.
#### Time Scales
The turbulent eddies introduce very small variations in each velocity component. These fluctuations change with time, but do so much faster than the time scale of a smooth manoeuvre. Hence, we don't need to know exactly what's going on, only what effect the fluctuations have over a specific time scale.
