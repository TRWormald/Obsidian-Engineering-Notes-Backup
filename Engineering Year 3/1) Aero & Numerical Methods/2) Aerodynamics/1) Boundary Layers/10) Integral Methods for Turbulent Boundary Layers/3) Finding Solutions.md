As with laminar flows, we have two options, differential or integral. For the usual reasons we will look at integral first:
- Quicker
- Easier to use
Due to the greater complexity of the flow, formal analytical solutions do not generally exist, and we shall be considering mainly empirical methods.
In particular we shall concentrate on [[4) Power Law Methods|Power Law Methods]]
