### Assumptions
We assume the following:
- 2D flow
- Steady flow
- Incompressible flow
- Viscous flow
- Negligible gravity and buoyancy
### Derivation of 2D Boundary Layer Equations
So moving from the 3D Navier Stokes Equations to the 2D realm we can ignore a lot of the terms:

Given these assumptions the continuity and Navier Stokes Equations become:
