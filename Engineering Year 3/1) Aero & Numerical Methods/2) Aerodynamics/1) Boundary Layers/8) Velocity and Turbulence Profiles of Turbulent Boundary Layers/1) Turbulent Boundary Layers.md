### The Velocity Profile of a TBL
There is a high velocity gradient, hence there must be a high wall shear stress:
$$\tau_{w}=\mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}_{y=0}$$
The velocity scales approximately with a power law as:
$$\frac{u}{U_{\infty}}=\left(\frac{y}{\delta}\right)^{\frac{1}{7}}$$
There are however limitations to the power law:
- The infinite velocity gradient is not physical
- It doesn't account for Re

The TBL can be divided into:
**The Inner Region**
![[Pasted image 20251030130029.png|centre|400]]
Which has three sub-regions. It scales with friction velocity ($u_{\tau}=\sqrt{\frac{\tau_{w}}{\rho}}$) and viscous length scale ($\delta_{\nu}=\frac{v}{u_{\tau}}$). 
The wall unit is a local Re: $y^{+}=\frac{y}{\delta_{\nu}}=\frac{yu_{\tau}}{\nu}$
The law of the wall similarity relation: $$\frac{U}{u_{\tau}}=f_{i}\left(\frac{yu_\tau}{\nu}\right)$$
**The Outer Region** (also known as the wake region)
Which scales with $u_{\tau}$ and $\delta$. The law of the wake (or defect law):
$$\frac{U_{\infty}-u}{u_\tau}=f_{o}\left(\frac{y}{\delta},\frac{u_{T}}{U_{\infty}}\right)$$
