The location of separation can be very difficult to predict, it depends on the pressure gradient, and a number of other factors:
- Geometry
- Laminar/turbulent
- Shock wave interactions
- Turbulence in the main flow
- 3D effects
### Shock wave interactions
Shock interactions only occur in supersonic flow, or flows with regions of supersonic flow, e.g.
- Flow over wings of aircraft in transonic flows
- Supersonic vehicles
- Rocket and jet exhausts
The boundary layer allows communication of presence of the shock wave upstream at the wall.
