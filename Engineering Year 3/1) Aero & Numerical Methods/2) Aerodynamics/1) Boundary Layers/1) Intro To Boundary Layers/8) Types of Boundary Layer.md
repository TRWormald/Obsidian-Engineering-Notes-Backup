- A laminar B.L is characterised by smooth layering.
- A turbulent B.L. is characterised by eddies and efficient mixing
- Transitional B.L. are characterised by intermittency, i.e. the flow is sometimes laminar, and sometimes turbulent.
>It should be noted that **separation and turbulence are not the same thing**.
>Consider low $\text{Re} (<100)$ flow around a ball. This flow is separated but still laminar.
>Consider high $\text{Re}$ flow around an aerofoil. This is a turbulent boundary layer but is *still attached.*
