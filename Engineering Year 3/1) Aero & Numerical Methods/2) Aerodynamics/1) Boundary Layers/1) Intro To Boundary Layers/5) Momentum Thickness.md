>The *Momentum Thickness* ($\theta$) tells us what the loss in the momentum of the flow is, compared to what would be the case were there no boundary layer.

It is defined as:
$$\rho_{e}u_{e}^{2}\theta =\int_{0}^{h}\rho u(u_{e}-u)dy,~~~~~\theta=\int_{0}^{h}\frac{\rho u}{\rho_{e}u_{e}}\left(1-\frac{u}{u_{e}}\right)dy$$
A change in momentum is equivalent to a force, this gives us the drag created by the boundary later, including both *skin friction* and *pressure drags*.
