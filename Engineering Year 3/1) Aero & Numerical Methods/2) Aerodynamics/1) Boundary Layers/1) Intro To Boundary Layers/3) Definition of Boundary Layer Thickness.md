>The boundary layer thickness is denoted by $\delta$, and is defined as the distance from the wall where the boundary later flow is indistinguishable from the external flow.

i.e.
$$u=u_{e}, ~\rho=\rho_{e},~\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}=\frac{\partial^2{u}}{\partial^2{y}}=...=0$$
Technically this can only happen an infinite distance from the wall, however $\delta$ is usually defined where $u=0.995u_e$, or some similar value.

Empirical relations can be used to estimate boundary layer thickness:

### So how thick is a boundary layer?
For a laminar B.L., $\delta$ grows proportional to $\text{Re}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$:
$$\frac{\delta}{x}\approx5\text{Re}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$
So if on the t.e. of an a/c $\text{Re}=10^{6}$
$$\frac{\delta}{c}\approx0.005$$
So if the chord is 3m, the boundary layer at the t.e. is 1.5cm thick.
> Note - the boundary layer might transition to a turbulent state, which is thicker.
