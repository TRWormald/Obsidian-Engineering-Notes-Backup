Displacement thickness $\delta^{*}$ is used as boundary layer thickness is a bit inexact (it depends on who close we set $u$ to $u_{e}$). Instead we can use displacement thickness, defined as:
$$\rho_{e}u_{e}\delta^{*}=\int_{0}^{h}(\rho_{e}u_{e}-\rho u)dy$$
$$\delta^{*}=\int_{0}^{h}\left(1-\frac{\rho u}{\rho_{e}u_e}\right)dy$$
Physically, this is the distance the wall would move to give an equivalent inviscid mass flow:
