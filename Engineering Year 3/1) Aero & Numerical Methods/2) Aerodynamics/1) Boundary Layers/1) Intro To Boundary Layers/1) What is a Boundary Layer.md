The image below shows the boundary layer of a plate (just out of shot at the bottom) in a flow.

The flow is laminar above the boundary layer and parallel to the plate, but as we get closer there is lots of turbulence.

### History
Until 1900, aerodynamics consisted of two separate fields:
1) Hydrodynamics (inviscid fluids)
2) Hydraulics (empirical)
But in 1904 Prandtl united these fields through Boundary Layer Theory.
### What is a Boundary Layer?
Even through viscosity $\mu$ is small, it cannot be neglected everywhere. Specifically in a Newtonian Fluid, the shear stress is related to strain rate:
$$\tau=\mu \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}$$
Wherever velocity changes rapidly in the normal direction, $\mu$ can cause significant $\tau$.
We have a no slip condition at the wall, i.e. $U=0$. If the flow reaches freestream only a small distance from the wall, then this is the case.

The boundary layer is very thin.
The use of the boundary layer concept depends on large Reynolds number for the main flow: $>10^4$ 
$$\text{Re}=\frac{\rho U l}{\mu}$$
The Reynolds Number is the ratio of Inertial to Viscous forces.
Usually $L$ is defined in the streamwise direction, but imagine for now it is a distance normal to the surface. Very near the surface, $L<<1$, hence $\text{Re}$ is small.
However if $\rho U>>\mu$, the Reynolds Number quickly rises with increasing $L$, and hence viscous forces are only important near the surface.
