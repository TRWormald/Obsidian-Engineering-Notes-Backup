As discussed, transition is very complex and difficult to model accurately/reliably in different situations. Fortunately for high Re it generally happens in a very short distance, so we can assume a point transition (a line in 3D).
The simplest method (and most common) is to specify a critical Re. Alternatively you could use pressure gradients. Or:
