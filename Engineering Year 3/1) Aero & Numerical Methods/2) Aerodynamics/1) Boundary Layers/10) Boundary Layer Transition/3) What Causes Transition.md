At all times tiny disturbances are introduced into the flow within the boundary layer, these are caused by:
- Noise and vibrations
- Turbulence in the external flow
- Non-uniformities in the surface
These disturbances travel in a wave like manner, and are called *Tollmein-Schlichting waves*. The direction, amplitude, and growth/decay can be calculated, and shown to be functions of the Reynolds number and pressure gradient.
### Tollmein-Schlichting Waves
In a laminar flow, where the Reynolds number is relatively low, the viscous forces damp these waves out. However, as we increase the Reynolds number:
- Inertial forces grow relative to viscous ones
- There comes a point where the waves are no longer damped, and as a result transition begins.
