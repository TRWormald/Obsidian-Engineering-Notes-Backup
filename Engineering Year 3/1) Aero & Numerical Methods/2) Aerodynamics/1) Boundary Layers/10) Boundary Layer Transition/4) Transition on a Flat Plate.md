### Schubauer and Skramstad's Results
The graphs below (which map $u'$ over time) show the boundary layer oscillations at different distances from the leading edge at two different speeds:

At the higher speeds we can see that there is initially laminar flow close to the leading edge, and as we get further from the LE the disturbances increase greatly until the flow becomes fully turbulent.
At lower speeds the disturbances are much lower even at a similar distance from the leading edge (note that a magnification factor has been applied to the lower speed results) - even at 11 feet from the leading edge the flow has not become fully turbulent.

They then produced this graph, which shows the relation between the non-dimensional frequency and $\text{Re}_{\delta}$.

### Transition in Other Situations
The transition process is effected by:
- $dP/dx$ with +ve pressure gradients speeding up transition, whilst -ve pressure gradients delay it.
- Roughness which speeds transition by forming turbulent spots directly
- High turbulence in the external flow also generates turbulent spots
- Suction delays transition by removing mass
- Cooling delays transition by removing energy
On a flat plate transition occurs between $\text{Re}_{x}=1.4\times 10^{5}$ and $\text{Re}_{x}=3.2\times 10^{6}$ depending on the above factors.
