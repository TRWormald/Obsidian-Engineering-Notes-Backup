Laminar boundary layers cannot tolerate even mildly adverse pressure gradients - as a result they *separate* but also *undergo transition*.
Turbulent free shear layers grow much more rapidly than laminar ones, hence can reattach to the surface, forming a separation bubble.

### Re Transition Influence
It should be noted that the [[Reynolds Number]] influences the point at which transition occurs:

As can be seen above, when the Reynolds number increases the point at which transition occurs shifts closer to the leading edge, and the size of the separation bubble decreases.
