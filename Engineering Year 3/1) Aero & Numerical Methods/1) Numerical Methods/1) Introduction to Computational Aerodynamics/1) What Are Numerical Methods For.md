>Finding approximate solutions to "hard" mathematical problems

### But how do we define hard?
- No analytical solution for general real world problems
- Problems are often very large - with many thousands of equations/DoF
As a result we calculate an **Approximate Solution**:
- Calculated with a finite amount of precision (decimal places)
- Calculated on a finite domain with finite fidelity
- Calculated with known error bounds (accuracy)

### The Application of Numerical Methods
- Linear algebra
	- Linear systems solution
	- Matrix inverses
	- Eigen decomposition
	- Singular value decomposition
- Function approximation
	- Interpolation, extrapolation, regression
	- Numerical integration (quadrature)
- Non-linear equations
	- Root finding
	- Optimisation
- Differential equations
	- ODEs
	- PDEs
