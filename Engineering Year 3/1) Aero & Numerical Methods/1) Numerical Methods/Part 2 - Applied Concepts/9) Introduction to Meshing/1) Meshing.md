>The generation of suitable meshes for CFD simulation about complex configurations constitutes a principal bottleneck in the simulation workflow process.

The generation of a "good" mesh is as important as an accurate flow solver. (We will cover what constitutes a good mesh later)
However, the mesh generation process remains a lengthy and non-automated process requiring specialised user skill.
