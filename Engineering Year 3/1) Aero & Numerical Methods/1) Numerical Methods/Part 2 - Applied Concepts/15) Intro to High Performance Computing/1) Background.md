CFD has traditionally drawn on the latest developments in high performance computing as a result of the large problems encountered.
### Technology Development
>**Moore's Law**
>For a fixed price, the performance of a computer will double every 18 months.

Up to the late 1990s progression was due to increases in hardware - technology development resulted in higher clock speeds and more operations per clock cycle.
Single core development then began to level off due to power issues and silicon manipulation limits. Nowadays the number of CPUs is more important than the expensive developments of them leading to larger and larger machines of cheap "commodity" hardware.

### HPC Trends
HPC machines continue to chase increased parallelism - i.e. increased core counts.
