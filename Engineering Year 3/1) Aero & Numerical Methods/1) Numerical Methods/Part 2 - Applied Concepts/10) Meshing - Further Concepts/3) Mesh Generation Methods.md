### Cut Cell Meshes
![[Pasted image 20251023132910.png|centre]]
Unlike other methods, the cut cell methods does not require a surface mesh to generate a volume mesh, only a "surface representation" (e.g. a CAD surface) is required which allows the computation of intersection with cells.
The volume mesh is then generated by starting from a single cell, and refining the mesh from outer to inner - and refining near the surface.

This approach needs a completely arbitrary cell shape unstructured solver, with a particular data storage method, but removes the mesh generation problem.
Its not good for viscous flows, however, so a hybrid approach can be used; viscous mesh around the surface, with the cut cell mesh intersecting the outer edge of the viscous layer. But this removes the advantage of not having to generate a surface mesh.
General unstructured meshes (e.g. tetrahedral) are generated by "advancing front" or Delauney triangulation procedures, which move away from solid surfaces; these methods therefore require a good surface mesh definition.
### Surface Meshes
>Most mesh generation methods are driven by the surface mesh distribution. The structure, topology, and quality of the volume mesh is highly dependent on that of the surface mesh.

If you have a poor quality surface mesh you will always get a poor quality volume mesh. For example, there must be a small cell size at aerofoil leading and trailing edges. This is where the flow gradients are the largest, and so need more points to capture them.
Mesh generation will often begin with some kind of CAD model, but this will not always be in a useable form for a CFD surface generator - a lot of time is spent "CAD-fixing".
### General Volume Mesh Generation
There are then many methods to compute the coordinates of the field mesh, based on the generated surface mesh. Three of the most popular are:
1) Solve a set of PDEs
	Numerically solving a set of equations, with - for example - terms defining orthogonality and stretching. The equations can be some combination of Laplace, Poisson, and Equidistribution equations. This is a three parameter problem, i.e. $i, j, k$ points are all generated simultaneously.
2) Hyperbolic marching from inner boundary
	Define the inner boundary distribution, and inner boundary normal direction only. The hyperbolic scheme then ‘marches’ away from the inner boundary. This can be useful for concave inner boundaries, since there is a repulsion type term, which ensures no mesh crossover is possible. However, the definition of the outer boundary cannot be determined prior to the generation, and this can cause problems. For example, when generating a multiblock mesh the block boundaries would be defined first, then the interior points computed. Hyperbolic is a two parameter problem, i.e. for each $k$ plane moving from inner to outer, $i,j$ points are generated.
3) Interpolation between the inner and outer boundaries
	Define the inner and outer boundary distributions, and using a weighted interpolation, which also includes a defined inner boundary normal direction term. This is much simpler than 1) or 2) since the mesh positions are available directly, i.e. the equations give $(x,y,z)=F(\text{inner, outer, normal})$. This is a one-parameter problem, as for each $i,j$ point on the surface, the interpolation generates each set of $k$ points independently. 
### CFL Condition in 2D/3D
We have encountered the CFL condition in one-dimension which gives the following upper bound on the allowable timestep:

In higher dimensions we have wavespeed(s), or signal propagation speed(s), in each coordinate direction.
If the mesh spacings are $\Delta x, \Delta y,\Delta z$ then the CFL condition becomes:
