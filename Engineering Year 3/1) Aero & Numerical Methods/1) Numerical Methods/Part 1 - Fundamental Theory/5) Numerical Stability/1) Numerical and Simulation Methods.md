Our objective is to develop and understand numerical methods to solve the Navier-Stokes equations.
We have considered forms of PDEs with:
- $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$
- $\frac{\partial}{\partial x,y,z}$
- $\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2},y^{2},z^{2}}$
We have introduced the model equation:
$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+c\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=0$
And we have introduced the concept of time marching.

We have also covered how a general programme works:

**Now we are going to consider the stability of numerical schemes**
