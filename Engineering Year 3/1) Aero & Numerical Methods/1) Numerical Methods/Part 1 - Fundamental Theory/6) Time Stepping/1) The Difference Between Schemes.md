The FTCS has higher order accuracy than the upwind method, but is unstable. Lets compare these:

If we compare the spatial difference approximations, i.e. consider the difference between the spatial terms for each (UPWIND - FTCS):

This looks like a finite difference formula - so what gradient does it represent?
