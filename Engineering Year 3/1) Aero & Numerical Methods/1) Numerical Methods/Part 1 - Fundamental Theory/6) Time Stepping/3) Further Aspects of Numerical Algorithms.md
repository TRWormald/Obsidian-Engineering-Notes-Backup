Before considering a more realistic example, consider the evaluation of the time step, $\Delta t$. Clearly we must satisfy the CFL condition, which gives a limit on the time-step. For a time-accurate solution, i.e. we wish to examine the solution evolution in time, the solution at every mesh point must be updated using the same time-step. If the wave speed and mesh spacing is constant we simply compute the global time step using:
$$\Delta t\le\frac{\Delta x}{|c|}$$
But if we either have non-constant mesh spacing $\Delta x(x)$ and/or non-constant wave speed $c(x)$ we must compute the time-step to satisfy the CFL limit at every mesh point. Then the only way to use the same time-step at every mesh point and still satisfy the CFL condition at every point is to use the minimum $\Delta t$ computed over the whole domain.
