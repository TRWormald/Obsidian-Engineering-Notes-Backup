### Pros and Cons
Swirl atomisers are commonly used because they have the following **advantages** compared to other nozzles:
1) Relatively simple design
2) High reliability
3) Good spraying quality
4) Small power required
However they do have the following **disadvantages**:
1) Limited use for atomisation of very viscous fuels
2) Small range of regulation, where regulation is understood as the ratio of the maximum and minimum flow rates
### Characteristic Parametrisation
A schematic diagram of the simplest swirl atomiser is shown below:

The characteristic parameters of swirl atomisers are represented by the geometric constant $K$:
$$K=\frac{Rr_{0}}{ir_{p}^{2}}=\frac{2Rd_{0}}{id_{p^2}}=\frac{\pi Rr_{0}}{iA_{p}}=\frac{2\pi Rd_{0}}{4iA_{p}}$$
Note that:
- $R$ is the swirl radius
- $r_{p}$ and $d_{p}$ are the radius and diameter of the tangential orifice, respectively
- $r_{0}$ and $d_{0}$ are the radius and diameter of the discharge orifice, respectively
- $i$ is the number of tangent inlet orifices
- $A_{p}$ is the cross section of the tangential inlet orifice with an arbitrary transverse shape
If the tangential inlet orifices are inclined to the swirl chamber axis at angle $\Theta$ then this equation assumes the form:
$$K=\frac{Rr_{0}}{ir_{p}^{2}}\sin\Theta=...$$
