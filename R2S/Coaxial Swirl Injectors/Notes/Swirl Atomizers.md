Swirl atomisers are commonly used because they have the following **advantages** compared to other nozzles:
1) Relatively simple design
2) High reliability
3) Good spraying quality
4) Small power required
However they do have the following **disadvantages**:
1) Limited use for atomisation of very viscous fuels
2) Small range of regulation, where regulation is understood as the ratio of the maximum and minimum flow rates
