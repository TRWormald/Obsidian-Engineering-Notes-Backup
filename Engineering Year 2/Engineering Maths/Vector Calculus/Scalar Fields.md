How do we visualise scalar fields $\phi=f(\vec{r})$? One way is to sketch **level sets** (= level curves, level surfaces, iso-surfaces)
These are the curves or surfaces where the scalar field is constant, hence:
$$\phi = constant$$
Consider in 2D where $\phi(\vec{r})=\phi(x,y)$, the most common application of scalar fields are on maps where the map contours are lines of constant height, however other examples include iso-bars showing areas of constant pressure on weather maps.
