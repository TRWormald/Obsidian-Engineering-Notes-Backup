Vector fields are harder to visualise. One needs to prepresent vectors at each point in space. One way to do this is by using arrows with varying length or thickness.

**In 2D** where $\vec{v}=v_{1}(x,y)\vec{i}+v_{2}(x,y)\vec{j}$ we can interpret this as the wind field plots on TV weather forecasts (at a given altitude), or a vertical view of a partially flattened field of corn or wheat.
The plot can be constructed by considering at a grid of points $x_{i},y_{j}$:
$$magnitude=|\vec{v}|=\sqrt{v_{1}^{2}(x_{i},y_{j})+v_{2}^{2}(x_{i},y_{j})}$$
$$direction~~ \theta=\arctan\left(\frac{v_{2}(x_{i},y_{j})}{v_{1}(x_{i},y_{j})}\right)$$
Which would result in a diagram like the following:

**In 3D**, where: $\vec{v}=v_{1}(x,y,z)\vec{i}+v_{2}(x,y,z)\vec{j}+v_{3}(x,y,z)\vec{k}$ a good way to visualise the field is to take 2D sections.
