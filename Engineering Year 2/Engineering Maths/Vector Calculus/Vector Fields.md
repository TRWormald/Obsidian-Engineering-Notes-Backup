Vector fields are harder to visualise. One needs to prepresent vectors at each point in space. One way to do this is by using arrows with varying length or thickness.

**In 2D** where $\vec{v}=v_{1}(x,y)\vec{i}+v_{2}(x,y)\vec{j}$ we can interpret this as the wind field plots on TV weather forecasts (at a given altitude), or a vertical view of a partially flattened field of corn or wheat.
The plot can be constructed by considering at a grid of points $x_{i},y_{j}$
