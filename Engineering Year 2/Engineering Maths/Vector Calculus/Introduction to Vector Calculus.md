### What is Vector Calculus?
It is effectively just joining the more traditional calculus techniques that we've learned to vector quantities.
It answers questions like how to define and measure the variation of temperature, fluid velocity, force, magnetic flux etc. over all dimensions of space. 
### Scalars, Vectors, Fields, and Functions
In vector calculus we will deal with four types of mathematical entities:
1) **A Scalar Function** (of only one variable)
   $f(x)\text{ or }f(t)$ is a formula that takes a scalar and returns a scalar.
2) **A Vector Function** (of only one variable)
   $\vec{v}(x)\text{ or }\vec{v}(t)$
   Which takes a scalar and returns a vector:
   $\vec{v}(t)=v_{1}(t)\vec{i}+v_{2}(t)\vec{j}+v_{3}(t)\vec{k}$
 3) **A Scalar Field** $\phi$ is a scalar quantity defined over a region of space. It takes a vector (of positions) and returns a scalar.
    $\phi=f(x,y,z)=f(\vec{r})\text{    (or }f(x,y)\text{ in 2D})$
 5) **A Vector Field** $\vec{v}(x,y,z)$ is a vector-valued quantity defined over a region of space. It is defined by a field that takes a vector (of positions) and returns a vector. $\vec{v}(\vec{r})=v_{1}(x,y,z)\vec{i}+v_{2}(x,y,z)\vec{j}+v_{3}(x,y,z)\vec{k}$
