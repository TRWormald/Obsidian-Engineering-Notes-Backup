$\vec{\nabla} f=\vec{0}$ defines the points at which the field $f(x,y,z)$ is flat. 
i.e. its stationary (extremum) points $=(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ such that:
$$0=\vec{\nabla}f=\left.\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right)\right|_{x=x_{0},~y=y_{0},~z=z_{0}}$$
Therefore: $f_{x}=f_{y}=f_{z}=0$ (conditions for a stationary point)
