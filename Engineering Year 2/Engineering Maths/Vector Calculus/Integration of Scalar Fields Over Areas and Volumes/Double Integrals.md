E.g. calculate the mass of a lamina occupying a region $R$ in the $(x,y)$-plane, whose density variation is $\rho(x,y)$.
$$\text{Area of R}=\int\int_{R}dA=\int\int_R dx~dy$$
Therefore:
$$\text{Total Mass}= \int\int_{R}\rho(x,y)~dx~dy$$
This is an example of a double integral which we interpret as representing the volume under the 'height function' $f(x,y)$ above the region $R$:

Effectively we are multiplying each of thee infinitesimal areas making up $R$ by the height at that specific point, giving us the volume.
\
Such integrals are calculated by first integrating with respect to one variable, then the other. According to notation we do the inner integral first:
$$\int\int f(x,y)~dx~dy=\int\left[\int f(x,y)~dx\right]dy$$
