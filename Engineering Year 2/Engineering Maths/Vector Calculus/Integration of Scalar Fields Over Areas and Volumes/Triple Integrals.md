In principle triple integrals are the same as double integrals, with an extra unknown. Triple integrals are also known as Volume integrals.

Consider a solid body occupying a volume $V$ in 3D. Let its density be $\rho(x,y,z)$. The mass of a small element $dxdydz$ is $\rho(x,y,z)dxdydz$.
Hence the total mass of the solid is:
$$M=\int\int\int_{V}\rho(x,y,z)dxdydz$$
The limits on the integration depend on the shape of the body and are best illustrated by [[Triple Integrals#Example 5.6|examples]].
#### Properties of Triple Integrals
Triple integrals satisfy the same three properties of being linear, decomposable and, in the case of constant limits separable.

#### Applications of Triple Integrals
We can also use triple integrals to define centres of gravity and moments of inertia for 3D bodies in analogy with the 2D cases.
