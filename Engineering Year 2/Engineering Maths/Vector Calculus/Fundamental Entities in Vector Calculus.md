### Scalars, Vectors, Fields, and Functions
In vector calculus we will deal with four types of mathematical entities:
1) **A Scalar Function** (of only one variable)
   $f(x)\text{ or }f(t)$ is a formula that takes a scalar and returns a scalar.
2) **A Vector Function** (of only one variable)
	 $\vec{v}(x)\text{ or }\vec{v}(t)$
	Which takes a scalar and returns a vector:
	 $\vec{v}(t)=v_{1}(t)\vec{i}+v_{2}(t)\vec{j}+v_{3}(t)\vec{k}$
3) **A Scalar Field** $\phi$ is a scalar quantity defined over a region of space. It takes a vector (of positions) and returns a scalar.
    $\phi=f(x,y,z)=f(\vec{r})\text{    (or }f(x,y)\text{ in 2D})$
4) **A Vector Field** $\vec{v}(x,y,z)$ is a vector-valued quantity defined over a region of space. 
	 It is defined by a field that takes a vector (of positions) and returns a vector. $\vec{v}(\vec{r})=v_{1}(x,y,z)\vec{i}+v_{2}(x,y,z)\vec{j}+v_{3}(x,y,z)\vec{k}$   
	 An example of this could be the spatial variation of fluid velocity $\vec{v}(x,y,z)$ in a steady flow.
