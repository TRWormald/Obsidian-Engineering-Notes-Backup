### Rigid body mechanics
The velocity of a rigid body $B$ rotating about a fixed axis can be described by angular velocity vector $\vec\omega$, where $\omega=|\omega|$ is the angular rotation speed (rad/s) and the direction $\hat\omega$ is the axis of (anti-clockwise) rotation. The velocity field at position $\vec{r}$ from the axis is given by:
$$\vec{v}(\vec{r})=\vec{\omega}\times\vec{r}$$
Then we can show that:
$$\text{div }\vec{v}=0,~~~~\text{curl }\vec{v}=2\vec\omega$$
that is, the curl of the velocity field has the direction of the axis of rotation and magnitude that is twice the angular speed of rotation
