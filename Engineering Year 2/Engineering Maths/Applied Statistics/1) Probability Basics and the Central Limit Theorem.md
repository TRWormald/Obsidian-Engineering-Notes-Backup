**The Normal Distribution is the Bedrock of Probability**
Below is a normal distribution:

The distribution function is:
$$X\sim N(\mu,\sigma ^{2})$$
And the probability density function is:
$$f_{X}(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}}$$
Where the PDF gives the value of $f_{X}$ at a given $x$.

The CDF (or cumulative density function) is the probability of $X\le x$ and can be calculated using:
$$\Pr(X\le x)=F_X(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f_{x}~dx$$
