Recall that a vector field $\mathbf{v}$ is only conservative if and only if $curl~\mathbf{v}=0 \Leftrightarrow \mathbf{v}=\mathbf{\nabla}\phi$, for some scalar function $\phi$.
We can now add the following result:
*If the vector field $\mathbf{F}$ is **conservative** then the work integral $\int_{A}^{B}\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf r$ between two points $A$ and $B$ is **independent of the path** $C$ chosen between $A$ and $B$ (provided $\mathbf{F}$ remains finite within a simple domain containing $A$ and $B$)*
\
Moreover, writing $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{\nabla}\phi$ we have:
$$\int_{C}\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=\int_{A}^{B}\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=\int_{A}^{B}\mathbf{\nabla}\phi\cdot d\mathbf{r}=\phi(\mathbf{b})-\phi(\mathbf{a})$$
Hence the integral only depends on the value of $\phi$ at $A$ and $B$ and is independent of the path taken between them.

We must use the previous force field:
$$\mathbf{F}=(2xy+z^{3},x^{2},3xz^{2})$$
