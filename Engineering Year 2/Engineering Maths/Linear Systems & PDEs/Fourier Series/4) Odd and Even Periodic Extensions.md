We have looked at how to analyse a *periodic function*, but what about non-periodic functions, how do we analyse them?
There are two different types to consider:
1) $f(t)$ is non-periodic, defined for all $t\in \mathbb{R}$
	- We solve these using a **Fourier Transform**
2) $f(t)$ is non-periodic, but defined only for a finite interval $0\le t\le L$
	- We can solve these by constructing a periodic function by repetition - the odd and even periodic extensions.
	- This leads to a **Fourier Half-Range Series**
### Generating the Odd and Even Functions
Let $f(t)$ be some function defined in the region $0\le t\le L$:

To make it an even function $f_{e}(t)$ we need to reflect it in the y-axis:
