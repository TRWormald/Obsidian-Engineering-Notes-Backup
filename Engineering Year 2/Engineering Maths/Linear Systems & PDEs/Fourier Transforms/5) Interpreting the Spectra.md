We know that we can obtain the arbitrary function $f(t)$ from an integral involving the frequency function $F(\omega)$:

What we are doing here is modifying the sinusoidal wave using the value of the frequency function to get the magnitude, and the phase angle to get the offset of the wave.
Doubling the frequency results in:

And as we can see, we are reading off a different value from the valu
