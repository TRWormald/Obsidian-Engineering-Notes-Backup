### Definition
A function $f(t)$ is **periodic with period** $T$ if $f(t+T)=f(t)$ for all $t$, and $T>0$ is the smallest positive constant for which this is true.

A function $f(t)$ with period $T$ has frequency $\omega$, given by:
$$\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}$$
### Properties
All periodic functions have the following properties:

**Sums of periodic functions**
- If $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ are periodic functions with period $T$, then $af(t)+bg(t)$ is a periodic function with period $T$.
- If $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ are periodic functions with periods $T$ and $T/n$, for $n$ any integer, then $af(t)+bg(t)$ is a periodic function with period $T$.
**Time re-scaling**
- If $f(t)$ is a periodic function with period $T$, then $f(at)$ is also periodic with period $T/a$, for any $a>0$
**Converting frequencies**
- To convert (angular) frequency $\omega$ to (ordinary) frequency $f$ use $f=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}$
