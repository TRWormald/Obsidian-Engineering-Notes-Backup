#### Defining the Problem
Find the solution $u(x,t)$ of the [[1) Introduction to PDEs#The Heat Equation|Heat Equation]]
on a finite domain:
$$u_{t}=\alpha ^{2}u_{xx}$$
$$0\le x\le L,~~~~ t>0$$
Subject to boundary conditions (perfect insulator/no heat flux):
$$u_{x}(0,t)=u_x(L,t)=0$$
For all $t>0$.
And an initial temperature distribution:
$$u(x,0)=h(x)$$
For all $0\le x\le L$.
