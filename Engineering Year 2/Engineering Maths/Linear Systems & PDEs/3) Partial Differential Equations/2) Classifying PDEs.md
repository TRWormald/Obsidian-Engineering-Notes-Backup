PDEs come in all shapes and sizes:
###### The basic language
- The dependent variable is what we are trying to solve for
- The independent variable is what the dependent variable is a function of 
- The order of a PDE is the order of the highest derivative that occurs in it
###### Linear
There are two types of linear PDEs:
- Linear - which is where the dependent variables and their derivatives appear only linearly:
