PDEs come in all shapes and sizes:
###### The basic language
- The dependent variable is what we are trying to solve for
- The independent variable is what the dependent variable is a function of 
- The order of a PDE is the order of the highest derivative that occurs in it
###### Linear
There are two types of linear PDEs:
- Linear - which is where the dependent variables and their derivatives appear only linearly, for example:
$$\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}+x\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+y \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=\sin(x)$$
- Linear homogenous - this is there the PDE is a linear PDE in which all terms contain a dependent variable or its derivative, e.g. :
$$\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}+x\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+y \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=0$$
###### Semi-Linear
This is where the PDE is only linear if you consider the terms in the equation with the highest derivetives.
###### Non-Linear
This is where the PDE is one that is not linear or semi-linear.
