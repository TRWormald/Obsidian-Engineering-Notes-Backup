The solution to a partial differential equation, unlike an ordinary differential equation, is a function of more than one independent variable.
PDEs are made up of partial derivatives.
There are "three great equations" which consistently crop up in physical science and engineering:
1) The heat equation
2) The wave equation
3) Laplace's equation
### The Heat Equation
The heat equation models the diffusion of heat through a one dimensional medium, with conduction coefficient $\alpha^{2}$:
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\alpha ^{2}\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x ^{2}}$$
