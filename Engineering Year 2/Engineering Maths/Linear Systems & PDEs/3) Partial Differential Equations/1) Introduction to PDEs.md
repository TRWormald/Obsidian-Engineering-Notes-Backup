The solution to a partial differential equation, unlike an ordinary differential equation, is a function of more than one independent variable.
PDEs are made up of partial derivatives.
There are "three great equations" which consistently crop up in physical science and engineering:
1) The heat equation
2) The wave equation
3) Laplace's equation
### The Heat Equation
The heat equation models the diffusion of heat through a one dimensional medium, with conduction coefficient $\alpha^{2}$:
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\alpha ^{2}\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x ^{2}}$$
It can be used to find the temperature $u$ of an object as a function of position $x$ and time $t$.
### The Wave Equation
This models the amplitude of a taught one-dimensional string with tension $T$ and mass density $\rho$; $c=\frac{T}{\rho}$ is the wave speed:
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=c ^{2}\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x ^{2}}$$
### Laplace's Equation
This models the steady-state temperature distribution in a conductive sheet:
$$\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}=0$$
It can be used, for example, to find the temperature of a heat bath as a function of position.
### Differences between PDEs and ODEs
> Are PDEs like grown up ODEs?

No because:
- The behaviour of a solution to a PDE, and the method we use to find it, depends strongly on the type of PDE
- The solution to a PDE, and the method we use to find it, depends crucially on the domain
- The solution to a PDE, and the method we use to find it, depends greatly on the boundary and initial conditions
- Even the rules for how to set up the PDE problem depend on the type of PDE and its domain
