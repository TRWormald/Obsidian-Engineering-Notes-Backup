There are several constraints surrounding how we can apply the separation of variables method:
1) The PDE must be linear
2) It can be used to solve the [[1) Introduction to PDEs#The Heat Equation|Heat Equation]], [[1) Introduction to PDEs#The Wave Equation|Wave Equation]], and [[1) Introduction to PDEs#Laplace's Equation|Laplace's Equation]]
3) We must have a finite domain in space
4) There must be a pair of homogeneous boundary conditions in space
	- We can cope with more general boundary conditions but only by modifying the problem
	- We can solve other parabolic, hyperbolic, or elliptic PDEs too - as long as its possible to separate the variables.
