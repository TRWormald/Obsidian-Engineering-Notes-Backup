There are many methods available for finding the solution of PDEs. We need to tailor our method to the type of PDE, the domain, and possibly even the boundary conditions.
There are:
**Analytical methods**, e.g.
- Separation of variables
- Method of characteristics (d'Alembert's method)
- Green's functions
- Laplace or Fourier transform
- Similarity solution methods
**Numerical methods**, e.g.
- Finite difference
- Finite element
- Method of lines
- Spectral methods
- Relaxation methods

However of these we will only be looking at **analytical methods**, specifically *separation of vairables* and *d'Alembert's method*.
