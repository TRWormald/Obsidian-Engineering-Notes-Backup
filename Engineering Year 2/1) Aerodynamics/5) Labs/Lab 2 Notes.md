**What effect does the model have on flow upstream of it? Are there any exceptions?**
None - because the flow is supersonic, meaning that the pressure information cannot propagate upstream.
There are no exceptions, asides from the fact that the system is closed and therefore some information could completely travel around the loop and then influence upstream.
**Why do the shocks as viewed on the schlieren screen have an apparent substantial thickness?**
We are seeing the shocks of multiple different Mach numbers due to the velocity decrease due to wall effects. As a result these shocks are superposed on each other spanwise and result in the "thick" image that we can see.
**Why do the trailing edge shocks appear more diffuse than the leading edge?**
They appear more diffuse because:
1) The range in which shocks are produced has shrunk because the speed has decreased as we pass through the shocks.
2) The boundary layer has increased in size meaning that the deflection angle has decreased resulting in weaker shocks.
**How closely do the measured and calculated pressures and Mach numbers along the tunnel wall match one dimensional theory? What causes the differences?**
One side of the wind tunnel is flat so we don't have a proper converging-diverging nozzle resulting in different pressures to the ideal 1D theory.
One way in which this can be seen is that the iso-lines are not parallel, resulting in bow shocks forming earlier. The streamlines are angled up into the aerofoil and therefore effectively increasing the angle of attack and hence the shock angle.
This might also increase the size of the boundary layer, resulting an increase in shock angle, and hence the earlier onset of bow shocks.
We also see Mach diamonds - due to the shocks reflecting off the walls.
**Why do the pressure coefficients not match the theory at high/low angles of attack, especially on the front surface? What causes this? Sketch the flow structure in this situation. Using compressible tables estimate the angle for which this flow structure should form, and suggest why the angles are different to this in the experiment.**

**In the hydraulic analogy, what represents density? What represents temperature? What represents pressure?**
Density = height of the water
Temperature = height of the water
Pressure = height of the water squared
### Learning Exercises
**Using the wedge aerofoil spreadsheet compute the theoretical Cp values on the front and rear faces of the upper surface for all measured angles of attack (the Mach number at the model location can be found from the wall data spreadsheet; it will be about 1.7 to 1.8). Plot these theoretical Cp values and the experimental ones on the same graph against α. Why does the aft surface pressure coefficient not match the theoretical predictions when the forward surface results do? (In other words, why is the offset between theory and experiment different for the forward and aft surfaces?**

**Why may the angle of attack measured be inaccurate? How can we measure this inaccuracy using tunnel geometry, $C_{p}$ values or $C_{l}$ Estimate the angle offset for this experiment using each approach.**

**What maximum pressure coefficient would be expected on the forward surface of the blunt body? What assumption is needed, and how accurate would we expect it to be?**
