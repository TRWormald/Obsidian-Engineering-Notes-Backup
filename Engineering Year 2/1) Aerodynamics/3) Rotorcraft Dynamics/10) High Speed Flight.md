A helicopters forward speed is limited by several factors:
- Retreating Blade Stall
- Adverse Compressibility Effects

### The Effect of Blade Area on Retreating Blade Stall

Basically larger chords result in higher speeds, but are less efficient in hover, whilst the opposite is true for smaller chords.
### High Speed Flight Limitations
1) Advancing Blade Compressibility (wave drag)
2) Retreating Blade Stall (and reverse flow regions)
This can be delayed by:
- Blade Design (e.g. BERP)
- Offloading the rotor thrust demands by the:
	- Addition of auxiliary wings (Lift Compounded)
	- Addition of auxiliary thrust (Thrust compounded)
	- Both
	- Advanced Blade Concept
### BERP Blade Tips
BERP stands for the British Experimental Rotor Program.
