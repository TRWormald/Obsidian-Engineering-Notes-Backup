### Rotor Dynamics
The dynamics of the rotor is influenced by how the blades are connected to the hub.
There are three possible degrees of freedom at the attachment point:
- Flapping (out-of-plane)
- Feathering (blade pitch)
- Lead-Lag (in-plane)
These DOF can be attained by incorporating discrete hinges at the blade root (an articulated rotor) or providing compliance in the blade root structure (often referred to as a bearing-less, hinge-less, or semi-rigid rotor).
#### Why Do We need Hinges?
Cierva’s first Autogiro (with no blade root hinge) would roll to port with increasing forward speed due to a lateral asymmetry of lift on the rotor disk. Incorporating a blade root flapping hinge cured this tendency by allowing the blades to flap. The upward flapping on the advancing side of the disk combined with the downward flapping on the retreating side of the disk resulted in an equalisation of the lateral lift distribution. Whilst this solved the problem, it created a new one!
**The Coriolis Effect**
Conservation of angular momentum is elegantly demonstrated by an ice skater whose spin rate increases as hands are brought close to their body. So it is for the rotor blade with it’s centre of gravity moving radially fore and aft as it flaps up and down around the disk azimuth.
The image below shows the lead-lag hinge, and how it reduces the radial variation of blade mass.

#### Blade Flapping Motion
It has been shown that as the blade flaps up, away from its steady state, the increased C.F. moment arm will provide a restoring force, acting like a return spring.
As the blade flaps up, the angle of incidence is increased and so therefore is the lift which tends to oppose the upward flapping motion.
As the blade flaps down, the angle of incidence is increased and so therefore is the lift which tends to oppose the downward flapping motion.
**THE BLADE AERODYNAMICS PROVIDE MOTION DAMPING.**
#### Blade Lagging Motion

Unlike the blade in flapping, the lagging blade has a much weaker "restoring spring" and far less aerodynamic damping from blade motion. Indeed the blade would have to exhibit extreme lagging to attain the same level of restoring effect. Alternatively the lead-lag hinge offset could be increased.
### Ground Resonance
The freedom of blades to move independently of each other in the rotor plane can lead to problems.
Coupled to a fuselage that also has freedom to move on its undercarriage the ability to "rock the boat" has on occasion been realised.

**HOW CAN WE AVOID GROUND RESONANCE?**
Any helicopter with a main rotor fundamental lag frequency less than 1R (rotor rotation frequency) is susceptible to ground resonance.
Stabilisation is achieved by damping the motion of the rotor blades or the undercarriage, or indeed both.
The Bristol Sycamore helicopter rotor used a combination of rubber snubbers and friction dampers to prevent wayward motion of the blades.
### Cierva's Achievements
So by the late 1920’s, Cierva had introduced a flapping hinge and a lagging hinge but no feathering hinge. He controlled his Autogiro by directly tilting the rotor disk, which effectively varied the pitch of the blades around the rotor azimuth – i.e. cyclic pitch control.
The Cierva “hat trick” – Vertical Take-Off The rotor was pre-spun on the ground (to approx. 150% normal rotor speed) by a mechanical take-off from the engine. Cierva now introduced a third hinge, the feathering hinge, to allow for collective blade pitch. Upon electing to take-off, the rotor drive was disengaged and all power directed to the propeller. The collective pitch was increased and stored kinetic energy was converted to potential energy.
