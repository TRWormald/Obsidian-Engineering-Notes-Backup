### Blade Hinge Arrangements

The order in which these are placed is also sometimes different:

**On the Tail Rotor Hub**
You have the teeter hub (2 bladed rotor, zero offset flapping hinge, no lead-lag hinge).
The requirements for the tail rotor hub are:
- Generally supercritical (fundamental lag frequency >1R)
- Collective <font color="#8064a2">pitch control</font> but no cyclic pitch control
- <font color="#d83931">Pitch-Flap</font> Coupling ($\delta_3$=45)

### Helicopter Stability and Control
A rotor system that has zero Flapping Hinge Off-Set (such as a two-bladed teeter rotor) has no ability to impart a moment into the fuselage.

Pitch and roll is achieved by orientating the thrust vector relative to the aircraft's centre of gravity. **THIS FORM OF CONTROL IS TOTALLY DEPENDENT UPON THRUST.**

### Stability and Control In Hover
If the helicopter was to experience a disturbance:

But we have seen how the teeter rotor doesn't "follow-on" in a vacuum. This principal can be used to provide a datum for a disturbed helicopter:
