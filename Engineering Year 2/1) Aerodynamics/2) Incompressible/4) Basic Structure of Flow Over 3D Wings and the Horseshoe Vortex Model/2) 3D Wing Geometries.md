Following are some of the most common wing geometries:

The wing type used most commonly in civil aviation is the swept trapezoidal wing:

Note that:
**The Average Chord** $\bar{c}$ is the average chord defined as $S/b$ where $S$ is the planform area and $b$ is the span.

**The Aspect Ratio** $AR$ is the ratio of span and the average chord:
	For a rectangular wing: $AR=b/c$
	For a non-rectangular wing: $AR=b^{2}/S$

**Taper Ratio** $\lambda$ is the ratio of the tip chord to the root chord assuming that the leading and trailing edges are straight lines:
$$\lambda = \frac{c_{t}}{c_{r}}$$
**Sweep Angle** $\Lambda$ is usually measured between the 25% chord line and a perpendicular to the root chord, but sweep angles for the leading and trailing edges are also presented.

**Geometric Twist** degines the situation where the goemetric angles of incidence for sectional chord lines are not the same

**Aerodynamic Twist** defines the situation where the aerofoil section varies in the spanwise direction, which leads to a spanwise variation in the zero lift angle of attack

**Dihedral/Anhedral** defines the angle between the wings and the horizontal:
