Previously we have considered chordwise sections of aerofoils of a rectangular wing of infinite span. The flow, and hence the pressure and the lift produced for each section of the wing are identical.

For wings of finites span, the question arises:
> How do the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing differ from that of its aerofoil sections?

It does so in the following ways:
- There is a pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of an aerofoil generating lift
- Flow always wants to move from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure.
- On the wing flow therefore "wraps" around the wing tips:

So when we consider the flow in 3D, there is a component of the flow which is in the spanwise direction.
### The 3D Flow Structure on Wings
The following diagrams show the above behaviour, with there being greater lift at the centre of the span, and less towards the edges.

### Basic Flow Structure on Wings
![[Pasted image 20250310164343.png|centre]]
The high pressure air beneath the wing curls around the wing tips towards the low pressure air on the upper surface.

This flow structure leads to a wake shear layer being shed from the trailing edge of the wing:

But this wake sheet is unstable and tends to roll up at the edges:

**This results in the formation of Tip Vortices**
