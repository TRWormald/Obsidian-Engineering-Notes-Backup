### Stiffness

> Stiffness is resistance to the displacement from the reference configuration

$$\text{stiffness}=\frac{\text{applied load}}{\text{deformation}}$$
There are a couple of equations for stiffness, based on different types of springs:

### Dampers and Viscous Damping

> Damping is responsible for forces which oppose motion. Viscous dampers/damping resists motion with the forces proportional to the relative velocity experienced between the ends of the damping element.

A couple of types of damper are:

### Rigid Bodies and Inertia
Newton's method introduces inertial forces and moments. These loads are in dynamic equilibrium with other applied and internal loads. Inertia properties such as mass and mass moment of inertia can be seen as a measure of resistance to acceleration.
$$F_{I}=-m\ddot{x}~~~~~~~~\text{translational motion}$$
$$M_{I,A}=-I_{A}\ddot\varphi~~~~~~~~~~\text{rotational motion}$$
Note that $I_{A}$ is the mass moment of inertia which can be calculated using:
$$I_{A}=\int_{(m)} r^{2}_{A}~dm=I_{A,1}+I_{A,2}~+~ ...$$
