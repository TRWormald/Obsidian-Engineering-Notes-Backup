### The Three Common Cases of Harmonic Excitation
#### Force Excitation

This is the kind of excitation that we have previously looked at - where an external force is applied to the system.
The mathematical model for this excitation is:
$$m\ddot{x}+c\dot{x}+kx=F_{0}\sin(\omega t)$$
#### Unbalance Excitation

Consider a 1DOF system with a mass $m_{U}$ rotating with constant angual speed $\omega$ with an offset $e$. We are interested in the dynamic response of the mass as well as the properties or characteristics of the system loaded in this way.

Based on this analysis, when constrained to move as a 1DOF system, the rotating unbalance causes harmonic excitation and the resulting EOM is:
$$m\ddot{x}+c\dot{x}+kx=(m_{U}\omega^{2}e)\cos(\omega t)$$
#### Base Motion Excitation

Consider a 1DOF system where no external force is applied. However, the ground (base) is allowed to move according to the known function of time $y(t)$:
