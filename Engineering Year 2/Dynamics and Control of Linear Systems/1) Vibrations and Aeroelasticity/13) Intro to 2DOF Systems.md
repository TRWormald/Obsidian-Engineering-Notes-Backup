Up until this point we have been looking at 1DOF systems:

We are now going to start exploring 2DOF systems, some examples of which are shown below:

### A 2DOF System
Consider the following 2DOF system:
![[Pasted image 20250128122510.png|centre]]
The main characteristics of this system are:
- The two masses characterised by the mass $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$
- Two independent displacements described by $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$
- Two DOFs and, therefore, two equations of motion
- Two applied forces $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ acting on the lumped masses
- Three springs with the stiffness parameters $k_{1}$, $k_{2}$, and $k_{3}$
- No
