Recalling the elementary system from [[1) Introduction|the first note in this theme]]:

Now with our understanding of [[4) Stiffness, Damping, and Inertia|stiffness and damping]] we can calculate the EOM to be:
$$ma+cv+kx=F(t)$$
or:
$$m\ddot{x}+c\dot{x}+kx=F(t)$$
Note how this is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time with a non zero RHS.
