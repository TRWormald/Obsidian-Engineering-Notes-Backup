Consider a 1 DOF (Degree Of Freedom) system for which we want to derive its mathematical model. 
This model will enable us to make quantitative predictions.
One way to achieve this is to use Newton's laws and apply them systematically to the point where we can start forming useful equations - *equations of motion*. This approach forms the basis of Newton's method:
