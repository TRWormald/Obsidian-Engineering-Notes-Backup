Consider a 1 DOF (Degree Of Freedom) system for which we want to derive its mathematical model. 
This model will enable us to make quantitative predictions.
One way to achieve this is to use Newton's laws and apply them systematically to the point where we can start forming useful equations - *equations of motion*. This approach forms the basis of Newton's method:

If we consider the free body diagram at the bottom of the image above we can proceed in one of two ways:

In Approach 1 we consider the accelerating forces acting upon the object (i.e. the overall force) resulting an equation for $ma$. However in Approach 2 we consider the object in "dynamic equilibrium" - i.e. we have an additional "inertial force" which balances out the resultant, meaning that the sum of the forces acting on the object are zero.

Note however that both of these methods result in the same equation of motion:
$$ma+F_{D}+F_{S}=F(t)$$
When rearranged to solve for $F(t)$.
