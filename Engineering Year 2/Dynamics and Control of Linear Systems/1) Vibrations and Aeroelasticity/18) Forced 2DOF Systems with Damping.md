We previously looked at systems with undamped TVA:

We are now going to look at damped TVAs:
### General Forced Damped 2DOF System
The damped 2DOF system looks like the following:

With equations of dynamic equilibrium:

And the EOMs in matrix form:

Note how we have a new term where $\mathbf{C}$ is the damping matrix.
### The Steady-State Harmonic Response
