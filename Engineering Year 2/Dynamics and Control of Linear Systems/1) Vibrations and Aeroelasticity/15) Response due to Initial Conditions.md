In this we will look at:
- Free response via mode superposition
- Initial Conditions
- A 2 DOF Example

### Mode Superposition
Consider a MDOF system without applied load (i.e. in free vibration) and with non-zero initial conditions:
$$\mathbf{M\ddot{x}+Kx=0}$$
The free response of this system can be expressed as a superposition of all the modes of the system:
$$\mathbf{x=a_{1}}(C_{1}\cos(\omega_{1}t +\varphi_{1}))$$
