There are two main schools of mechanics:
1) Newtonian or vector mechanics
This is based on the use of Newton's laws involving forces and moments
2) Lagrangian or analytical mechanics
This is based on the use of extremum energy considerations

>"Vibrations can be described as repeating motion (oscillation) of the system about an equilibrium configuration"
#### Main Concepts
There are a couple of main concepts that we will need to understand:
1) **Newtons Laws**
These are what we will use to identify forces acting on moving rigid bodies.
$$\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}$$
$$\mathbf{F}_{AB}=-\mathbf{F}_{BA}$$
$$\mathbf{v}_{\text{ref}}=\text{constant}$$
2) **Degrees of Freedom**
These are the minimum number of coordinates that will be sought to define completely the configuration of a mechanical system at any point in time.

>Application of Newton's laws, while considering all degrees of freedom, leads to the equations which describe the motions of bodies under the influence of the applied (external) forces.

These are the equations of motion and they come in the form of ordinary (or partial) diff
