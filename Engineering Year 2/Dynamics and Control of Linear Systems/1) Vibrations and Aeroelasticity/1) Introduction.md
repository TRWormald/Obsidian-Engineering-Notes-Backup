There are two main schools of mechanics:
1) Newtonian or vector mechanics
This is based on the use of Newton's laws involving forces and moments
2) Lagrangian or analytical mechanics
This is based on the use of extremum energy considerations

>"Vibrations can be described as repeating motion (oscillation) of the system about an equilibrium configuration"
#### Main Concepts
There are a couple of main concepts that we will need to understand:
1) **Newtons Laws**
These are what we will use to identify forces acting on moving rigid bodies.
$$\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}$$
$$\mathbf{F}_{AB}=-\mathbf{F}_{BA}$$
$$\mathbf{v}_{\text{ref}}=\text{constant}$$
2) **Degrees of Freedom**
These are the minimum number of coordinates that will be sought to define completely the configuration of a mechanical system at any point in time.

>Application of Newton's laws, while considering all degrees of freedom, leads to the equations which describe the motions of bodies under the influence of the applied (external) forces.

These are the equations of motion and they come in the form of ordinary (or partial) differential equations involving time derivatives of the motion-defining coordinates.
#### Terminology, Symbols, Notation, etc.
Some initial statements:
- Vibrations are mechanical oscillations about the *equilibrium configuration*
- Vibrating systems typically possess or feature flexibility and inertia
- Real vibrating systems also display mechanical energy "dissipation"

>To move from a “real problem” to a “mathematical model”, we need to apply simplifications, approximations, abstraction, judgement, expertise, common sense, etc. With this “toolset”, we can arrive at a “mechanical model” which should capture the “essence of the problem”

The simplest foundational example of a mechanical model of a vibrating system is:

There are also several different types of vibrations (including but not limited to):
- Free vibrations - vibration when forcing not present
- Forced vibrations - vibration when forcing present or applied
- Periodic vibrations - vibratory motion described by a periodic function
- Harmonic vibrations - vibratory motion described by a harmonic function (i.e. cosine)
- Undamped/damped vibrations - monotonous vibration decaying toward the equilibrium configuration
- Unstable vibrations - vibration growing without bounds.
