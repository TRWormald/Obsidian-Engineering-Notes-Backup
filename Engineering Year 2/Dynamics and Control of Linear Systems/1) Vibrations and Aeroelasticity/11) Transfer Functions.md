The FRFs can be used to:
- Calculate the steady-state response of linear vibrating systems
- Characterise linear vibrating systems
	- They can be calculated or measured, hence, also used as a comparison measure between models and experiments
	- They have special properties that reveal the hidden system behaviour which enables effective design decisions.
