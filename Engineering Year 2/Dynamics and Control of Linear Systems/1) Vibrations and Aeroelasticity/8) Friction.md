### The Coulomb Model of Dry Friction
The Coulomb model of dry friction is the simplest friction model. Friction is the resistance to the relative motion between two objects due to uneven contacting surfaces. This simple model is represented by the constant motion-opposing force.

We can use alternative ways to indicate the presence of friction in our problems or model sketches:

The equation of motion takes the form:
