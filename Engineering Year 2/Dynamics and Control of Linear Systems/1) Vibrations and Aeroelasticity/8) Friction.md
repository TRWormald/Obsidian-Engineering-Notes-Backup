### The Coulomb Model of Dry Friction
The Coulomb model of dry friction is the simplest friction model. Friction is the resistance to the relative motion between two objects due to uneven contacting surfaces. This simple model is represented by the constant motion-opposing force.

We can use alternative ways to indicate the presence of friction in our problems or model sketches:

The equation of motion takes the form:

### Free Vibration with Friction
We shall now consider free vibration with the effects of friction taken into account:

The function $\text{sign}$ has three possible discrete values: -1, 0, and 1. Thus all three cases have to be considered independently:
$$\text{sign}(\dot{x})=\left\{\begin(matrix)\end(ma\right.$$
