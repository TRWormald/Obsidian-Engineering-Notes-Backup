We have [[10) Harmonic Excitation|previously]] looked at Force, Unbalance, and Base Excitation, and the [[11) Transfer Functions#Frequency Response Function|FRF]] and its equivalents.
We're now going to look at:
- Multi-harmonic excitation
- Impulse excitation

>We know about the principle of superposition - where the total solution is the sum of all partial solutions resulting for individual components of excitation. We can apply this to harmonic excitation by forming multiple differential equations describing the motion of a system and simply adding the resulting functions describing displacement.
