### Maintenance Philosophies
- Run to failure
	- Run until it breaks
- Time based maintenance
	- Inspect/maintain after so long or so many cycles
- Condition based maintenance
	- Measure/monitor continually

#### HUMS (Health and Usage Monitoring Systems)
They can be used to determine the state of a component or structure (**diagnosis**)
However they can also perform **prognosis** - how long left does a component have before it fails.
