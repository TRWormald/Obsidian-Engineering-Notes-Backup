Design a wing to give:
- Shortest take-off distance:
	Minimise $C_{D}-\mu C_{L}$ at zero incidence
- Highest top speed
	Minimise $C_{D_{0}}$ in flight

### Aileron Objectives
- Smallest value of aileron system mass
- Specified minimum value of $\frac{dC_{roll}}{d\delta_{a}}>0.35$

Noting that:
$$C_{roll}=\frac{M_{roll}}{\frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}S b}$$
Which is the rolling moment coefficient.
### Restrictions
- Wing planform is fixed, so all wings have the same reference area
- Movable surface layout is fixed
- Can select aerofoil and control angles (subject to a maximum thickness to allow manufacture, otherwise you cant fit your hands inside)
