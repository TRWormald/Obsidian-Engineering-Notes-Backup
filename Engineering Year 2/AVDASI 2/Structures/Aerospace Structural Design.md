There are several challenges that we must overcome when designing aircraft structures:
- What geometric envelope must my structure fit into?
- What type of loads must it support?
- How large are these loads and how often must they be carried?
- What is the thermal/chemical environment around my structure and how does this fluctuate?
- What material must I select to cope with the loading and environment?
- In what ways might the structure fail and how do I avoid this?
- What lifetime do I need the structure to last for?
- What structural configuration should I use?
- What is the best structural cross section to use?
- How do I join my structural parts together?
- How do manufacturing methods affect the strength?
- What tolerances can I accept?
- How will the material properties degrade?

When considering materials we are interested in their properties:
	**Mechanical:
- Specific Stiffness
- Specific Static Strength
- Fatigue Strength
- Fracture Toughness
- Hardness
	**Practical**:
- Availability and producibility
- Material costs
- Fabrication characteristics
	**Environmental**
- Erosion, abrasion and wear resistance
- Compatibility with other materials (galvanic)
- Thermal & electric characteristics
- Corrosion and embrittlement
- Environmental stability

Materials don't necessarily have the same properties - even if they are the same.
Therefore we use 'knockdown factors' to move from the material mean
