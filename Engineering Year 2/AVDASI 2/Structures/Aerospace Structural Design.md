There are several challenges that we must overcome when designing aircraft structures:
- What geometric envelope must my structure fit into?
- What type of loads must it support?
- How large are these loads and how often must they be carried?
- What is the thermal/chemical environment around my structure and how does this fluctuate?
- What material must I select to cope with the loading and environment?
- In what ways might the structure fail and how do I avoid this?
- What lifetime do I need the structure to last for?
- What structural configuration should I use?
- What is the best structural cross section to use?
- How do I join my structural parts together?
- How do manufacturing methods affect the strength?
- What tolerances can I accept?
- How will the material properties degrade?
\
When considering materials we are interested in their properties:
	**Mechanical:
- Specific Stiffness
- Specific Static Strength
- Fatigue Strength
- Fracture Toughness
- Hardness
	**Practical**:
- Availability and producibility
- Material costs
- Fabrication characteristics
	**Environmental**
- Erosion, abrasion and wear resistance
- Compatibility with other materials (galvanic)
- Thermal & electric characteristics
- Corrosion and embrittlement
- Environmental stability
\
Materials don't necessarily have the same properties - even if they are the same.
Therefore we use 'knockdown factors' to move from the material mean characteristics to a design allowable:

### Load Limits and Load Factors
Ultimate design load - limit load x ultimate safety factor (1.5)
Proof load - limit load x proof factor
	A test load producing an accepted limited permanent plastic deformation after which the component can still be used in service
Factor of safety - a factor to establish a safe design load allowing for uncertainties in design, e.g. proof factor and ultimate safety factor.
Limit load - maximum anticipated load in operation
### Check Factors
Reserve factor, RF=$\frac{\text{allowable stress}}{\text{applied stress}}$
Defined at proof or ultimate
Allowable stress represents the maximum that the material can be assumed to carry before failure, allowing for variability + environment.
Applied stress is the stress induced in the component at proof or ultimate load
RF<1 implies failure
RF>1 implies a reserve of strength
\
Margin of safety = $\frac{\text{allowable stress}-\text{applied stress}}{\text{applied stress}}$
MoS=RF-1
