There are several challenges that we must overcome when designing aircraft structures:
- What geometric envelope must my structure fit into?
- What type of loads must it support?
- How large are these loads and how often must they be carried?
- What is the thermal/chemical environment around my structure and how does this fluctuate?
- What material must i select to cope with the loading and environment
