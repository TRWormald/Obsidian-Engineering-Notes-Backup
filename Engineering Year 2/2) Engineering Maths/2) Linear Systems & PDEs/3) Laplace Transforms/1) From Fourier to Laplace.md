In a Fourier Transform we move from the time to the frequency domain:

Whereas with a Laplace Transform me move from the time to the Laplace domain:

We use Laplace transforms widely in engineering as:
- They work for many more signals and systems than Fourier
- They provide a systematic method for solving linear ODEs
- They provide a general way to formulate a transfer function of an input-output system
*They therefore provide the basic language of control engineering.*
