We previously looked at [[19) Energy Methods|energy based methods]] for solving NDOF problems.
Now we will look at:
- Pitching-heaving wing demos, and the basic intuition behind the phenomena
- Historical examples
- Professor Collar's Aeroelastic Triangle
- An overview of basic phenomena
- Elementary Aerodynamic Characteristics
### Suspended Rigid Wing In Airstream
Consider a rigid wing elastically suspended with the heaving and torsional DOFs. The wing is placed in a wind tunnel like configuration, i.e. exposed to free airstream with velocity $U$. The velocity is varied:

### The Origins of Aeroelasticity
Aeroelasticity goes all the way back to the earliest development of aircraft - the Wright brothers had to solve these problems as their wing sections were deforming at high thrust loadings.
Aeroelasticity is effectively the effect of aerodynamic forces on a structure.
### Collar's Aeroelastic Triangle

Developed by Arthur Collar, who was a professor at Bristol University.
Looking at this in a slightly different light:
