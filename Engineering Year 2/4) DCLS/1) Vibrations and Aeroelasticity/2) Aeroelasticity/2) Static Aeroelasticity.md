Static aeroelasticity is the study of flexible aircraft structures under steady aerodynamic loads:
- Aero loads influence structural shape and vice versa
- Forces and moments are independent of time
- Only steady aerodynamics are considered
- Divergence, control reversal, lift control effectiveness, etc.
The effect of control surfaces:
- Used to manoeuvre aircraft
- Change the effective camber of the aerofoil and therefore the lift
- Application of control surface rotation causes wing deflection
