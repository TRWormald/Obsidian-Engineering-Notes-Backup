Consider the closed section in the following diagram to be in pure torsion:

Pure torsion means that there are no shear or axial forces, i.e. no direct stresses:
$$\sigma_{z}=0$$
If we recall the differential shear flow equation for thin walled members:
$$t\cancel{\frac{d\sigma_{z}}{dz}}+\frac{dq_{(s)}}{ds}=0$$
So:
$$\frac{dq_{(s)}}{ds}=0$$
Therefore, the shear flow is constant throughout the section; we call it the **closed-cell shear flow** $\bar{q}$.
### Applied Torque vs Shear Flow
Writing the stress-resultant torque about an arbitrary point $O$ we get:
$$\begin{align*}
M_{z}=T&= \oint q_{{(s)}}r_{(s)}~ds\\
&= \bar{q}\oint r_{(s)}~ds
\end{align*}$$
The cross section of the closed section looks as follows:
