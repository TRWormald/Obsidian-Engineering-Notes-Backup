We make several assumptions about thin walls:
1) Direct stresses are constant through the thickness:
$$\sigma_{z_{(n)}}=const.$$

2) Through-thickness stresses are negligible:
$$\sigma_{n}=0,~~~~~~~~\tau_{zn}=0$$

3) In plane shear stresses are constant through the thickness:
$$\tau_{zs_{(n)}}=const.$$

Following these assumptions, we define a new vectoral quantity called **shear flow**, i.e. shear force per unit arclength $s$:
$$\boxed{q_{(s)}=t_{(s)}\cdot\tau_{zs}}$$
Its units are usually $\text{[N/mm]}$

### Calculating Shear flow in Open Thin-Walled Sections
We will consider a small element of the thin wall (within the $z-s$ plane)

Two stress components exist: $\sigma_{z}$ and $\tau_{sz}$.
Balancing the forces in the $z$ direction we get:
$$d\tau$$
