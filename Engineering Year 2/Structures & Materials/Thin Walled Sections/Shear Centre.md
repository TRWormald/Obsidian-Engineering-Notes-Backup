### Stress-Resultant Torque $M_{z}$
The shear flow field always follows the contour of a section, this field represents stress-resultant forces acting over the section.
Taking an arbitrary point as the origin of the $X-Y$ plane, these forces are seen to generate a stress-resultant torque $M_{z}$.
We define a new function, $r_{(s)}$ representing the orthogonal distance between vector $q_{(s)}$ and this arbitrary reference point.

The total torque is then:
$$M_{z}=\int_{s}q_{(s)}r_{(s)}~ds$$
### The Local Moment Arm
The local moment arm function $r_{(s)}$ can be positive or negative, following the right-hand rule about axis $Z$.
The function depends on the chosen reference point, i.e. the origin of the $X-Y$ plane.
- A convenient reference point must be chosen for each particular case
- If the section contains a radius then the centre of this radius must be taken as the reference point.

### Shear Centre - Point of Zero Stress-Resultant Torque
There is a point within the $X-Y$ plane where the stress-resultant torque for a section will always be zero
