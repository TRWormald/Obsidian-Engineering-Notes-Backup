### Stress-Resultant Torque $M_{z}$
The shear flow field always follows the contour of a section, this field represents stress-resultant forces acting over the section.
Taking an arbitrary point as the origin of the $X-Y$ plane, these forces are seen to generate a stress-resultant torque $M_{z}$.
We define a new function, $r_{(s)}$ representing the orthogonal distance between vector $q_{(s)}$ and this arbitrary reference point.
