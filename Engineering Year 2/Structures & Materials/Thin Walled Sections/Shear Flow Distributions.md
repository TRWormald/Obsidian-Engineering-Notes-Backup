Along a given wall $i$ of arclength ($0\le s\le b_{i}$) we write:
$$^{i}q_{(s)}=q_{[i-1]}-C_x\int_{0}^{s} {^{i}x_{(s)}}{^{i}t_{(s)}}~ds-C_{y}\int_{0}^{s}{^{i}y_{s}}{^{i}t_{s}}~ds$$
Where:
$$\begin{align*}
C_{x}&= \frac{S_{x}I_{xx}+S_{y}I_{xy}}{I_{xy}^{2}-I_{xx}I_{yy}}\\
C_{y}&= \frac{S_{y}I_{yy}+S_{x}I_{xy}}{I_{xx}I_{yy}-I_{xy}^{2}}
\end{align*}$$
The constant of integration $q_{[i-1]}$ is the 'initial value' of $q_{(s)}$, i.e. at the end of the wall $(i-1)$ and at the start of the wall $(i)$.
If wall $i=1$ starts from a free edge, the constant $q_{0}=0$
### Conventions for Plotting Shear Flow
- Draw one graph per 'wall'
- Use height of graph to represent magnitude of the shear flow
- Draw arrows to indicate sense - avoiding ambiguity
- Important to obey the shear flow rules:
	- $q_{(s)}$ is zero at free edges
	- $q_{(s)}$ is continuous around the section
	- $q_{(s)}$ is conserved at branches
	- For vertical on-axis shear loading
		- Webs - parabolic distribution of $q_{(s)}$
		- Flanges - linear distribution of $q_{(s)}$
