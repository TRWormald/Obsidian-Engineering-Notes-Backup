### Global Axes
We use the uppercase roman letters (X,Y,Z) to describe the *global coordinate system* (global CS)
This is also sometimes called the *structural coordinate system*.
The origin and orientation of the global CS are somewhat arbitrary.

In the diagram above we have made the $Z$ the longitudinal (span-wise) direction, so that any cross sectional plane will be parallel to the $XY$ plane.
We will also use the terms 'horizontal' and 'vertical' for the $X$ and $Y$ directions respectively.
### Centroid-based Axes
This is a local coordinate system which is defined with the origin **at the centroid** of the cross section, but parallel to the global CS.
We will use the lowercase roman letters ($x,y,z$) for this coordinate system.

### Rotations and Moments
Rotations and moments are defined with respect to centroid-based axes ($x,y,z$) or global axes ($X,Y,Z$) by application of the **right hand rule** about each orthogonal axis.
Moments are vectoral quantities represented by arrows with double arrowheads.
To find the positive direction of rotation, apply the RHR about each vector.

### Loading Axis (angle $\theta_{L}$)
We will be considering loads along or about any arbitrary loading axis, oriented in the ($x,y$) plane by the angle $\theta_{L}$.
- Shear loads are applied along the loading axis
- Moments are applied about the loading axis
Moment vectors can be operated on just like force vectors:
- Resultant can be decomposed into orthogonal components and vice versa.

### Neutral Axis (angle $\alpha$)
