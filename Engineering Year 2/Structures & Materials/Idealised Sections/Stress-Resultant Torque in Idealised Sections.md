The following equations can be used to calculate the effective boom area of a boom $k$ with connected booms $l$, loaded along $y$ and $x$ respectively.
$$B_{k}=J_{k}+\sum\limits_{\text{all connected booms } l}\left[\frac{b_{kl}t_{kl}}{6}\left(2+\frac{y_{l}}{y_{k}}\right)\right]$$
$$B_{k}=J_{k}+\sum\limits_{\text{all connected booms }l}\left[\frac{b_{kl}t_{kl}}{6}\left(2+\frac{x_{l}}{x_{k}}\right)\right]$$
Effective boom areas may contain cross-sections of joints or local reinforcements like stringers, park caps or longerons $J_{k}$.
Since shear flow values $q_{i}$ are assumed to be constant between booms, stress resultant torques $(q_{i}r_{i}b_{i})$ can be calculated using the geometrical interpretation of $\int r_{(s)}ds$.
\
The torque $M_{z}$ produced by the shear flow about any point $O$ in the plane of the section can eb obtained from:
$$^{i}M_{z}=q_{i}(2 \hat{A}_{i})$$
Where $\hat{A}_{i}$ is the total area enclosed by wall $i$ and the lines joining the ends of the wall to point $O$:

Thus, the stress-resultant torque about any reference point is the product of the shear flow and twice the area subtended between the web and this reference point.
*Note that the area is effected by the RHR as well, so in the image above the area will be negative because we are moving clockwise!*
