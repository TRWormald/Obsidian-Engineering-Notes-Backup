We need to be able to transform section properties by rotating them about structural axes.
\
**2D orthogonal coordinates ($x,y$) can be rotated (transformed) by any angle $\beta$ through:**
$$\begin{bmatrix}x'\\y'\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}m&n\\-n&m\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}$$
Where:
$$m=\cos\beta$$
$$n=\sin\beta $$
Therefore the transformed coordinates are:
$$x'=mx+ny$$
$$y'=-nx+my$$

*So what happens to 2nd moments of area upon axis transformation?*
### Transformation of SMAs
We now have transformed second moments of area
