Aircraft structures follow the ‘semi-monocoque’ design philosophy:
- Axial members forming ‘truss’ or ‘frame’ constructions
- Stressed-skin members where structural loads are resisted by outer skin
\
As we move to more realistic thin-walled structures, it becomes necessary to simplify our analyses by assuming that:
1. Skins are good at resisting in-plane shear stresses $𝜏_{𝑧𝑠}$ but are poor at resisting direct stresses $𝜎_𝑧$ as they tend to buckle in compression 
2. Booms carry all direct stresses $𝜎_𝑧$ , e.g. spar caps, stringers, longerons etc. 
3. As a consequence, the shear flow is constant between booms

**Booms** - are axial members that sustain/transmit *direct stresses*
- The 'effective boom area' includes the cross-sectional area of local axial members such as stringers, stiffeners, spar caps, or longerons
- However, it also includes the contribution of neighbouring skins, and their cross-sectional areas are assumed to be concentrated or lumped at points.
**Skins** - are thin webs that sustain/transmit *shear stresses*
- Skins are usually thin and buckle easily, not carrying direct stresses
- However, they are very good at resisting shear stresses, both under shear loading and/or torsion
- Usually they comprise the outer skin and spar webs.
### Structure Idealisation
Skins act as diagonal members in pin-jointed truss structures:

### Effective Boom Areas
The 'lumping' or 'concentration' of skin areas is based on equilibrium of bending stresses and bending moments.

Balancing moments $M_{n}$ at boom 2 gives:
