Aircraft structures follow the ‘semi-monocoque’ design philosophy:
- Axial members forming ‘truss’ or ‘frame’ constructions
- Stressed-skin members where structural loads are resisted by outer skin
\
As we move to more realistic thin-walled structures, it becomes necessary to simplify our analyses by assuming that:
1. Skins are good at resisting in-plane shear stresses $𝜏_{𝑧𝑠}$ but are poor at resisting direct stresses $𝜎_𝑧$ as they tend to buckle in compression 
2. Booms carry all direct stresses $𝜎_𝑧$ , e.g. spar caps, stringers, longerons etc. 
3. As a consequence, the shear flow is constant between booms
