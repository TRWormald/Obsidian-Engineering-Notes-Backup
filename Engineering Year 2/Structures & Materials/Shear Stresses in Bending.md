### Recap of Y1 Content
In Y1 we only considered shear forces, but shear strains in beams were neglected.
Shear strains are negligible if the aspect ratio (span/thickness) is large. In reality however cross-sections warp due to shear stresses. i.e. sections deform out of plane in a non linear fashion:

This can be seen in the I-beam above, where the flanges have deformed differently to the web.
**Planar sections don't necessarily remain planar.**
#### Shear Stress Definition
The shear stress $\tau$ is a measure of 'tangential force per unit area'. It arises when we apply a 'sliding force' to the surface:

It is a field property, which means that it can vary continuously within a body and can be considered at a point.
$$\tau=\lim_{\delta A\rightarrow0}\frac{\delta S}{\delta A}$$
