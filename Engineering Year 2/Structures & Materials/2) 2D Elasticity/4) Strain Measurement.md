We can use various methods to measure strain:
1) Strain gauges
Strain measurement at discrete locations and directions.
1) Photo-elasticity
Full-field measurement technique, which relies on change in refractive index (of a coating) with stress.
3) Digital Image Correlation
Tracks relative displacement $(u,v)$ of fine speckle pattern, from which strain field is calculated.
