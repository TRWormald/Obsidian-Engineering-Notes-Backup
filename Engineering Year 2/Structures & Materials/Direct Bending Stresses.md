### Beam Bending
In Year 1 we considered beam bending in only 2 dimensions meaning that we could use the equation:
$$\frac{M}{I}=\frac{\sigma}{y}=\frac{E}{R}$$
However now we are in Year 2 we will be considering bending in more than one direction and hence the same equation (in exactly the same scenario) now becomes:
$$\frac{M_{x}}{I_{xx}}=\frac{\sigma_{z}}{y}=\frac{E}{R_{x}}$$
