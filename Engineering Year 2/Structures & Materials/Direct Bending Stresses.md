### Beam Bending
In Year 1 we considered beam bending in only 2 dimensions meaning that we could use the equation:
$$\frac{M}{I}=\frac{\sigma}{y}=\frac{E}{R}$$
For a simple cantilever beam bending:

However now we are in Year 2 we will be considering bending in more than one direction and hence the same equation (in exactly the same scenario) now becomes:
$$\frac{M_{x}}{I_{xx}}=\frac{\sigma_{z}}{y}=\frac{E}{R_{x}}$$
The linear stress distribution also becomes:
$$\sigma_{z(y)}=\frac{M_{x}}{I_{xx}}y$$
These relationships are much clearer when considered in 3D:
