When amorphous or glassy or semicrystalline materials are cooled down from their molten state to solid state when the molecular motions of the long chains are blocked, the transition is called glass transition.
$T_{m}$ and $T_{g}$ are important parameters that decide defining upper and lower temperature for many applications.
These depend on several factors which are linked to molecular motions.
$T_g$ and $T_m$ increase with increase in: 
- Chain stiffness (e.g., saturated vs unsaturated) 
- Chain length - Molecular weight 
- Branching [more branching introduces defects and lowers mp]: for example, high density polyurethane is predominantly linear has higher Tm of 137 °C, compared to low-density polyurethane (Tm = 115 °C) which has some branching. 
- Presence of polar groups
