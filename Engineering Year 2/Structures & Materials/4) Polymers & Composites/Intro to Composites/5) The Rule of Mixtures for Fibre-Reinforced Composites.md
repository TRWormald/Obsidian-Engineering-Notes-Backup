Due to the direction of the fibres being so key for the strength of a FRC we have two different equations to calculate the longitudinal modulus, and the transverse modulus of the composite.

The longitudinal modulus $E_{1}$ is calculated using an Iso-strain assumption - i.e. the fibres and matrix behave as springs in parallel:
$$E_{1}=V_{f}E_{f}+(1-V_{f})E_{m}$$
Where $V$ is the volume fraction of the $_{f}$ fibres or the $_{m}$ matrix.

The transverse modulus $E_{2}$ is calculated using an Iso-stress assumption - i.e. the fibres and matrix behave as springs in series:
$$E_{2}=\frac{E_{f}E_{m}}{(1-V_{f})E_{f}+V_{f}E_{m}}$$
