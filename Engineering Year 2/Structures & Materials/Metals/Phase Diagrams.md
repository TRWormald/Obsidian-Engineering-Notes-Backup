There are various grades of steel:
1) Mild (low-carbon) steels
	Less than 0.2% Carbon, cold worked, low yield strengths (200-300MPa)
2) High-strength low-alloy steels
	Less than 0.2% C + alloying elements (Cu, Ni, V, Cr), medium yield strengths (250-600MPa)
3) Medium-carbon steels
	0.25-0.5% C, heat treated, medium yield strengths (300-1000MPa), widely used in structural applications but no so much in aerospace
4) Medium-carbon low-alloy steels
	0.25-0.5% C + alloying elements (Ni, Cr, Mo, V), high yield strengths (up to 2000MPa), higher alloy contents give hard tool steels; landing gear usage
5) Maraging steels
	High allow contents but no carbon (<0.03%), age-hardened, high yield strengths (1500-2300MPa), widely used in aerospace
6) Stainless steels
	0.08-0.25% C + 12-26% Cr, precipitation hardened, used in aerospace
### Microstructural Phases of Steel
Steel has different microstructures based on a variety of factors.
