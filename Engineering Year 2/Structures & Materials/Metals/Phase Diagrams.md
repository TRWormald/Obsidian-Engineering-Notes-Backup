### Introduction
Phase diagrams are 2D diagrams that describe the equilibrium states and microstructures (i.e. phases) present in an alloy as a function of two variables, often the composition and the temperature.
There are Binary Phase Diagrams, which show alloys containing two elements.
With two main systems being represented on them. Isomorphous systems:
![[Pasted image 20241101152249.png|centre|400]]
Where there is complete liquid and solid solubility of the two components.
And also eutectic systems:
![[Pasted image 20241101152617.png|centre|400]]
Meaning that there is no complete solid solubility, and there are three single-phase regions: $\alpha$, $\beta$, and liquid. 
### Solubility Limit
For many alloy systems and at some specific temperatures there is a maximum concentration of solute atoms that may dissolve in the solvent to form a solid solution, this is called a solubility limit.
The addition of solute in excess of this solubility limit results in the formation of another solid solution or compound that has a distinctly different composition (like a precipitate).
### Phases
A phase is a homogeneous partition of a system that has uniform physical and chemical characteristics. Every pure material is considered to be a phase, so is every solid, liquid and gaseous solution.
If more than one phase is present in a given system, each will have its own distinct properties, and a boundary separating the phases will exist, across which there will be a discontinuous and abrupt change in physical and/or chemical characteristics.
### Phase Equilibria
Equlibrium is an essential concept; it is best described in terms of a thermodynamic quantity called "free energy". Free energy is a function of the internal energy of a system and also the randomness or disorder of the atoms or molecules. A system is at equilibrium if its free energy is at a minimum under some specified combination of temperature, pressure and composition. In a macroscopic sense, this means that the characteristics of the system do not change with time, but persist indefinitely - that is, the system is stable.
A change in temperature, pressure, and/or the composition for a system in equilibrium results in an increase in the free energy and in a possible spontaneous change to another state by which the free energy is lowered.

Phase equilibrium refers to equilibrium as it applied to systems in which more than one phase may exist. Phase equilibrium is reflected by a constancy with time in the phase characteristics of a system. A change in temperature/pressure/composition will result in a new equilibrium being established.
In many metallurgical and materials systems of interest, phase equilibrium involves just solid phases. In this regard the state of the system is reflected in the characteristics of the microstructure, which necessarily include not only the phases present and their compositions, but, in addition, the relative phase amounts and their spatial arrangement or distribution.
It is often the case, especially in solid systems, that a state of equilibrium is never completely achieved because the rate of approach to equilibrium is extremely slow; such a system is said to be in a nonequilibrium or metastable state. A metastable state or microstructure may persist indefinitely, experiencing only extremely slight and almost imperceptible changes as time progresses. Often, metastable structures are of more practical significance than equilibrium ones. For example, some steel and aluminium alloys rely for their strength on the development of metastable microstructures during carefully designed heat treatments.
# Binary Phase Diagrams
Binary phase diagrams are maps that represent the relationships between temperature and the compositions and quantities of phases at equilibrium, which influence the microstructure of an alloy. Many microstructures develop from phase transformations, the changes that occur when the temperature is altered (typically upon cooling). This may involve the transition from one phase to another or the appearance or disappearance of a phase. Binary phase diagrams are helpful in predicting phase transformations and the resulting microstructures, which may have equilibrium or nonequilibrium character.
### Binary Isomorphous Systems
A good example of a isomorphous system is the copper-nickel system below:
![[Pasted image 20241103143301.png|centre]]
The liquid $L$ is a homogeneous liquid solution of both copper and nickel. The $\alpha$ phase is a substitutional solid solution consisting of both Cu and Ni atoms with a FCC crystal structure. At temperatures below 1080 degrees copper and nickel are mutually soluble in each other in the solid state for all compositions.
On the diagram there are several important lines:
- **Liquidus** line - This defines the limit between coexisting solid-liquid phases and a pure liquid phase
- **Solidus** line - This defines the limit between a pure solid phase and coexisting solid phases.
### Binary Eutectic Systems
A good example of a binary eutectic system is shown below:
![[Pasted image 20241101152617.png|centre|400]]
It shows a copper-silver phase diagram, note how compared to the isomorphous system there are more phases. We have the liquid phase $L$, the solid phases $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which are copper and silver rich respectively. We also have the combination regions, $\alpha+L$, $\beta+L$ and the solid $\alpha+\beta$.   
In addition to these additional regions we have another important line:
- **Solvus** line - defines a solid solubility limit; e.g. pure $\alpha$ to $\alpha+\beta$ and vice versa.
We also need to think about the **Eutectic reaction**, this is where upon cooling, a liquid phase $L$ transforms into two solid phases $\alpha+\beta$ completely and at a constant temperature. This occurs when an alloy of eutectic composition $C_{E}$ reaches the eutectic temperature $T_{E}$.
### The Lever Rule
We can use the lever rule to give phase amounts and phase composition when in equilibrium.
For example we can use the lead-tin phase diagram to characterise the Pb-Sn alloy of composition $C_{1}$ (40 wt% Sn) at $T=150$ centigrade: ![[Screenshot 2024-11-03 150246.png]]
Phase compositions are given by the intersections of the tie line (or isotherm) with the boundaries of the phase region (here the two solvus lines).
Therefore $C_{\alpha}=11~wt\%$ and $C_{\beta}=98~wt\%$ tin.

Phase amounts are given by the relative distances between the point of interest and the ends of the tie line.
![[Pasted image 20241103150642.png|centre]]
So the mass fraction of phase $\alpha$:
$$W_{\alpha}=\frac{\text{Length of }\alpha}{\text{Total Length}}=\frac{C_{\beta}-C_{1}}{C_{\beta}-C_{\alpha}}=\frac{98-40}{98-11}=0.67$$
Hence the mass fraction of phase $\beta$:
$$W_{\beta}=\frac{\text{Length of }\beta}{\text{Total Length}}=\frac{C_{1}-C_{\alpha}}{C_{\beta}-C_{\alpha}}=\frac{40-11}{98-11}=0.33$$

Effectively what this means is that we have a solid consisting of two phases of the alloy, one which is 11% tin, and the other which is 98% tin. However the former makes up 0.67 by weight of the entire solid, whilst the latter only makes up 0.33.
