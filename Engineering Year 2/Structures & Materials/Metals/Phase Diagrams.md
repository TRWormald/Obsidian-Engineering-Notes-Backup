Phase diagrams are 2D diagrams that describe the equilibrium states and microstructures (i.e. phases) present in an alloy as a function of two variables, often the composition and the temperature.
There are Binary Phase Diagrams, which show alloys containing two elements.
With two main systems being represented on them. Isomorphous systems:

Where there is complete liquid and solid solubility of the two components.
And also eutectic systems:

Meaning that there is no complete solid solubility, and there are three single-phase regions: $\alpha$, $\beta$, and liquid.
