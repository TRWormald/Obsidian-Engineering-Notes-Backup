Phase diagrams are 2D diagrams that describe the equilibrium states and microstructures (i.e. phases) present in an alloy as a function of two variables, often the composition and the temperature.
There are Binary Phase Diagrams, which show alloys containing two elements.
With two main systems being represented on them. Isomorphous systems:

Where there is complete liquid and solid solubility of the two components.
And also eutectic systems:

Meaning that there is no complete solid solubility, and there are three single-phase regions: $\alpha$, $\beta$, and liquid. 
### Solubility Limit
For many alloy systems and at some specific temperatures there is a maximum concentration of solute atoms that may dissolve in the solvent to form a solid solution, this is called a solubility limit.
The addition of solute in excess of this solubility limit results in the formation of another solid solution or compound that has a distinctly different composition (like a precipitate).
### Phases
A phase is a homogeneous partition of a system that has uniform physical and chemical characteristics. Every pure material is considered to be a phase, so is every solid l
