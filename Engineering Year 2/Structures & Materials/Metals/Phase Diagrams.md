There are various grades of steel:
1) Mild (low-carbon) steels
	Less than 0.2% Carbon, cold worked, low yield strengths (200-300MPa)
2) High-strength low-alloy steels
	Less than 0.2% C + alloying elements (Cu, Ni, V, Cr), medium yield strengths (250-600MPa)
3) Medium-carbon steels
	0.25-0.5% C, heat treated, medium yield strengths (300-1000MPa), widely used in structural applications but no so much in aerospace
4)
