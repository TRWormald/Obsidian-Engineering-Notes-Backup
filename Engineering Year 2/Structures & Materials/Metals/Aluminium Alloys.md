Aluminium alloys account for 60 to 80% of the weight of the airframes of most modern aircraft, helicopters and space vehicles.
Their advantages are:
- Moderate cost
- Various fabrication methods available
- High specific stiffness & strength
- Ductility, fracture toughness and fatigue resistance.
- Variety of mechanical and thermal treatments
Disadvantages:
- Soften when above ~150 degrees centigrade
- Suffer stress corrosion cracking
- Suffer galvanic corrosion when in contact with carbon fibres
- Precipitation strengthening makes welding difficult
### Types of Aluminium Alloys
There are two main types of aluminium alloys:
- Casting alloys
	Used in the as-cast condition without mechanical or heat treatments
	They often have inferior mechanical properties, and are rarely used in aerospace.
- Wrought alloys
	Some form of plastic forming involved in manufacturing, e.g. via drawing or rolling.
	They can be non-age-hardenable or age-hardenable.
	The former are strengthened by solid solution, cold working, and grain boundary, resulting in yield strengths below 300 MPa.
	For the latter, precipitation hardening is the most effective strengthening mechanism, resulting in yield strengths of 450 to 600 MPa. These are widely used in aerospace.

#### Non-age-hardenable Alloys
These are 1000,3000, 5000, and most 4000 series alloys. They can only be strengthened using solid solution strengthening, grain boundary strengthening, and cold working.
