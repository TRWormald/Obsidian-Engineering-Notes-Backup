Titanium is often used in airframe structures, landing gear components, and jet engine parts.
The advantages to using titanium are:
- High strength
- Long fatigue life
- High fracture toughness
- Good strength creep
- Excellent resistance to corrosion and oxidation
- No hydrogen embrittlement
- Maintains good performance at high temperatures
- Can be welded or diffusion-bonded
- Lower galvanic corrosion when in contact with carbon fibres
It does however have a number of disadvantages:
- Relatively high density compared with aluminium and carbon fibre composites
- Relatively low specific stiffness compared to other aerospace materials
- High cost, as a combination of costlier extraction from ore and costlier processing and forming techniques
- Difficult to machine, requiring specialist processes (e.g. laser machining)
