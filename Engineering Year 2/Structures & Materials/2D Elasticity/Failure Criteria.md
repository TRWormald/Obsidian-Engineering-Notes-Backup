When does a material fail under combined loading conditions?
How do we extrapolate from uniaxial tests to compound stress states?
How do we account for different failure mechanisms: ductile and brittle.
\
We assume that a material is elastic after which it fails suddenly or yields plastically.
The goal is to define a yield envelope that separates elastic from plastic deformation; any stress state within its boundaries is elastic. We will define this in terms of principal stresses.

### Failure @ Maximum Principal Stress
This is failure when maximum principal stress reaches a critical value.

This applies quite well to failure of brittle materials such as ceramics and cast iron.
### Failure @ Maximum Principal Strain
This is failure when maximum principal strain reaches a critical value.
