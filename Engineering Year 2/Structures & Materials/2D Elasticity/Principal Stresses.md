Looking at this graph from [[Stress and Stress Transformation]] we can identify that:
- Minimum/maximum direct stress occur in the principal directions
- The maximum and minimum direct stress for a given direction are offset by 90 degrees
- The shear stress is always zero in the principal directions, and maximum/minimum at a 45 degree offset.

#### Principal Stresses and Principal Directions
*For any state of stress, there exist perpendicular principal directions with corresponding principal stresses, where (i) direct stress is maximum or minimum, and (ii) shear stress is zero*:

We explored this slightly when[[Defining Axes#Principal Axes (1,2) (angle $ theta_{P}$)| defining axes]] except there they were defined at the maximum/minimum se
