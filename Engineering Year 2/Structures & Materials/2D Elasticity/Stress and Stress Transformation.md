### Stress Definition
*The total stress on an infinitesimal element of a plane taken within a deformed elastic body is defined as the resultant of all the actions of the molecules situated on one side of the plane upon the molecules on the other side.*
**Saint-Venant (1797-1886)**

An infinitesimal element of material with dimensions $dx×dy ×dz$ is subjected to direct stresses $σ_{xx}$ and shear stresses $τ_{xy}$ . Direct stresses act normal to a face, whereas shear stresses act parallel.

The first index in these defines the face on which the force acts, whilst the second tells you the direction of the stress.
### Complementary Shear
As the elements we will be considering are in equilibrium the shear stresses are not independent:

If we consider moment equilibrium about the centre of this infinitesimal element:
$$\tau_{xy}=\tau_{yx}$$
