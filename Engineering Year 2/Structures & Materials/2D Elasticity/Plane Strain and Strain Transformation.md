When we have *plane strain* deformations are strictly limited to the *XY* plane.
**Don't** confuse plane strain and plane stress:
$$\text{plane strain : }\varepsilon_{zz}=\gamma_{xz}=\gamma_{yz}=0,\text{but }\sigma_{zz}\ne 0$$
$$\text{plane stress : }\sigma_{zz}=\tau_{xz}=\tau_{yz}=0,\text{but }\varepsilon_{zz}\ne 0$$
In plane stress, although $\sigma_{zz}=0$, thickness $t$ may vary due to $v$ (Poisson's Ratio):

*The only times that plane stress and plane strain are the same is when*:
- There are no loads
- $\sigma_{xx}=-\sigma_{yy}$
- The plane is in true shear
- etc.

### Strain Transformations
Like with the stress transformation, we can transform strains using
