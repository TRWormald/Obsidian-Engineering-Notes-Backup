### Materials Consumption
We consume $10^{10}$ tonnes of engineering "stuff" every year:
- Hydrocarbon fuels (oil and coal) dominate - $9\times 10^{10}$ tonnes per annum
- Construction industry consumes vast quantities of materials (wood, steel, concrete, asphalt (tarmac), glass)
- There is a big growth in carbon fibre consumption (driven by expansion in aerospace)
### Rates of Materials Consumption
For small growth rates (1-5% per year), consider $r$ as percentage fractional rate of growth per year.
Integrating over time:
$$C=C_{0}e^{\left(r\left(\frac{t-t_{0}}{100}\right)\right)}$$
Where $C_{0}$ the consumption rate at $t=t_{0}$
The doubling time $t_{D}$ of consumption is obtained by setting $C/C_{0}$ to give:
$$t_{D}=\frac{100}{r}\log_{e}(2)\approx \frac{70}{r}$$

*Note: at a global growth rate of just 3% per year we will mine, process, and dispose of more stuff in the next 25 years than in the entire history of human engineering.*
