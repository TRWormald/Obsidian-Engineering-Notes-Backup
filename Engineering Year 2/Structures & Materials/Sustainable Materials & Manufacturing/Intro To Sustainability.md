### Materials Consumption
We consume $10^{10}$ tonnes of engineering "stuff" every year:
- Hydrocarbon fuels (oil and coal) dominate - $9\times 10^{10}$ tonnes per annum
- Construction industry consumes vast quantities of materials (wood, steel, concrete, asphalt (tarmac), glass)
- There is a big growth in carbon fibre consumption (driven by expansion in aerospace)
### Rates of Materials Consumption
For small growth rates (1-5% per year), consider $r$ as percentage fractional rate
