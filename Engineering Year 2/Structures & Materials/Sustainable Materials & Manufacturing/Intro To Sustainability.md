### Materials Consumption
We consume $10^{10}$ tonnes of engineering "stuff" every year:
- Hydrocarbon fuels (oil and coal) dominate - $9\times 10^{10}$ tonnes per annum
- Construction industry consumes vast quantities of materials (wood, steel, concrete, asphalt (tarmac), glass)
- There is a big growth in carbon fibre consumption (driven by expansion in aerospace)
### Rates of Materials Consumption
For small growth rates (1-5% per year), consider $r$ as percentage fractional rate of growth per year.
Integrating over time:
$$C=C_{0}e^{\left(r\left(\frac{t-t_{0}}{100}\right)\right)}$$
Where $C_{0}$ the consumption rate at $t=t_{0}$
The doubling time $t_{D}$ of consumption is obtained by setting $C/C_{0}$ to give:
$$t_{D}=\frac{100}{r}\log_{e}(2)\approx \frac{70}{r}$$

*Note: at a global growth rate of just 3% per year we will mine, process, and dispose of more stuff in the next 25 years than in the entire history of human engineering.*

### Three Pillar Thinking
![[Pasted image 20241122142359.png|centre|400]]
- Along with economic considerations, the social and environmental performance of a material is crucial for making sustainable decisions.
- Traditional view - environmentalists vs business
- We need to radically redesign our industrial systems to create more value with fewer resources
### The New Design Paradigm
We must therefore design with different ideas in mind, some of these are explored below:
#### Design For Environment
When we design things we need to consider the materials that we are going to use (materials down-selection), as well as the production of those products.

We must choose materials that have a minimal impact on the environment throughout their lifecycle, from extraction or production to disposal or recycling.
This approach aims to reduce environmental degradation, conserve resources and minimise pollution.

#### Design for Sustainability
DfS is an approach to product design focused on minimizing environmental impact and enhancing resource efficiency throughout the product lifecycle. Goal: Reduce negative environmental impacts while maximizing social and economic benefits.
#### Design for Disassembly
- A sustainable design approach focused on creating products that can be easily disassembled at the end of their life. 
- Facilitates recycling, repair, and reuse to support a circular economy and minimize waste.
This can be achieved by:
- Modular design
- Material compatibility
- Standardised connectors
- Minimise components
