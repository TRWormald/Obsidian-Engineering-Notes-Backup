Mohr's circle was proposed as a convenient geometrical representation of tensorial transformations.
There are two versions 2D and 3D but we will focus on the two dimensional variant.
\
It is a geometrical description of tensorial transformations (rotations) - describing *extensional* and *distortional* components as functions of the rotation angle $\theta$.

The horizontal axis contains your second moments of area with repeated indices - $I_{xx}, I_{yy}$.
The vertical axis contains the product second moment of area $I_{xy}$.
\
We also plot:
$$I_{avg}=\frac{I_{xx}+I_{yy}}{2}$$
$$R=\sqrt{\left(\frac{I_{xx}+I_{yy}}{2}\right)^{2}+(I_{xy})^2}$$
(Where $R$ is the square root of the sum of the squares of $I_{avg}$ and $I_{xy}$. Note that on the diagram above $I_{avg}$ is marked as $C$)
\
After marking these values we draw a circle of radius $R$ and centre $I_{avg}$. The angle that the line between $I_{avg}$ and $I_{xy}$ and the horizontal axis makes is 2$\theta$ or two times the angle which transforms between the principal axis and the arbitrary axis.
