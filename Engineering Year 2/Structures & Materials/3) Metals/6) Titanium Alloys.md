Titanium is often used in airframe structures, landing gear components, and jet engine parts.
The advantages to using titanium are:
- High strength
- Long fatigue life
- High fracture toughness
- Good strength creep
- Excellent resistance to corrosion and oxidation
- No hydrogen embrittlement
- Maintains good performance at high temperatures
- Can be welded or diffusion-bonded
- Lower galvanic corrosion when in contact with carbon fibres
It does however have a number of disadvantages:
- Relatively high density compared with aluminium and carbon fibre composites
- Relatively low specific stiffness compared to other aerospace materials
- High cost, as a combination of costlier extraction from ore and costlier processing and forming techniques
- Difficult to machine, requiring specialist processes (e.g. laser machining)

### Phases of Titanium
![[Pasted image 20241104133408.png|centre]]

Pure titanium has a transus temperature of 885 degrees centigrade. The beta phase is only stable above it, whilst the alpha phase is only stable below it.
Elements with a lower valence number than Ti are $\alpha$-stabilisers, for example Aluminium and Tin. 
Elements with a higher valence number than Ti are $\beta$-stabilisers, for example Vanadium, Molybdenum, Chromium, and Copper. 
Elements with the same valence number as Ti are neutral. They can be used for strengthening or other purposes.
Alloys can be $\alpha$-Ti, $\beta$-Ti, or $\alpha$ + $\beta$-Ti, with the latter being shown below:
