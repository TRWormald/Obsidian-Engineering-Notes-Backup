There are various grades of steel:
1) Mild (low-carbon) steels
	Less than 0.2% Carbon, cold worked, low yield strengths (200-300MPa)
2) High-strength low-alloy steels
	Less than 0.2% C + alloying elements (Cu, Ni, V, Cr), medium yield strengths (250-600MPa)
3) Medium-carbon steels
	0.25-0.5% C, heat treated, medium yield strengths (300-1000MPa), widely used in structural applications but no so much in aerospace
4) Medium-carbon low-alloy steels
	0.25-0.5% C + alloying elements (Ni, Cr, Mo, V), high yield strengths (up to 2000MPa), higher alloy contents give hard tool steels; landing gear usage
5) Maraging steels
	High allow contents but no carbon (<0.03%), age-hardened, high yield strengths (1500-2300MPa), widely used in aerospace
6) Stainless steels
	0.08-0.25% C + 12-26% Cr, precipitation hardened, used in aerospace
### Microstructural Phases of Steel
Steel has different microstructures based on a variety of factors. Several of these are listed below:
##### Austenite ($\gamma$-Fe), FCC structure
This is a face centred cubic structured steel, it typically only occurs above 723 degrees centigrade, but can be stable at room temperature by adding Nickel or Magnesium.

##### Ferrite ($\alpha$-Fe), BCC structure
This is a body centred cubic structured steel, it is the natural phase of pure Fe, and can only contain up to 0.022 wt% C in solid solution.
It is soft and ductile.

##### Cementite (Fe$_{3}$C), orthorhombic structure
This is an iron carbide, it is a hard and brittle ceramic-like material
It is composed on 6.7 wt% C, and 93.3 wt% Fe.

##### Pearlite: Lamellar Structure of Ferrite and Cementite
This is formed by the slow cooling of austenite, the carbon diffuses out of the newly formed ferrite and into layers of cementite. It is composed of 87.5 wt% ferrite, 12.5 wt% cementite, therefore ~0.8 wt% C.

### Non-Equilibrium Cooling
By cooling down steel at different rates we can change the molecular structure:

#### Bainite
Bainite is produced by the moderate cooling of Austenite, it is a plate like (non-laminar) structure of cementite and dislocation rich ferrite. It has intermediate properties between pearlite and martensite.
##### Martensite
Martensite is a very hard form of steel, obtained from rapid quenching of austenite. It is a distorted body-centred tetragonal (bct) structure, supersaturated with carbon.
Quenching promotes local micro-shearing and high dislocation densities.
### Maraging Steels
This is a method whereby you age Martensite to produce favourable material properties.
$$Maraging=Martensite + Ageing$$
Maraged steels are effectively carbon-free steels but with high alloy content.
Martensic structure is formed by the slow air cooling of austenite.
The martensite is softer than that of quenched carbon steels, this provides ductility and fracture toughness without tempering, and allows for machining without tempering as well.
You then thermally age it for precipitation hardening, resulting in a yield strength of ~2000 MPa plus a high ductility and toughness.
### Stainless Steels
Stainless steels are low carbon (0.08-0.25%) but high chromium (12-26%). The chromium on the surface reacts with oxygen in the air to form a thin layer of chromium oxide, which protects the material.
There are a few different types:
- Ferritic
- Austenitic
- Martensitic
- Precipitation-Hardened (PH)

Precipitation hardened stainless steels are widely used in aerospace. They have a martensitic structure (stiffness + hardness) + tempering (ductility, toughness).
Stainless steels have been replaced by Titanium alloys in several applications, but are still used extensively in engine pylons, landing gear, etc.
