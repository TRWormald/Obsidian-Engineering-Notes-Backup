Mohr's circle was proposed as a convenient geometrical representation of tensorial transformations.
There are two versions 2D and 3D but we will focus on the two dimensional variant.
\
It is a geometrical description of tensorial transformations (rotations) - describing *extensional* and *distortional* components as functions of the rotation angle $\theta$.

The horizontal axis contains your second moments of area with repeated indices - $I_{xx}, I_{yy}$.
The vertical axis contains the product second moment of area $I_{xy}$.
\
We also plot:
$$I_{avg}=\frac{I_{xx}+I_{yy}}{2}$$
$$R=\sqrt{\left(\right)}$$
