The above image shows an arbitrary thin-walled section subjected to a transverse (downward) shear force. The resultant shear stresses are parallel to the wall, as if they were "flowing" along the cross-section.

### Coordinates in Open Thin-Walled Sections
When analysing thin-walled sections we define two new coordinates:
- The arc length "$s$", tangent to the local mid-surface of the section.
- The through-thickness coordinate $n$, normal to the local mid-surface of the section.
These can be seen in the diagram below:

### Solving the Problem
**Step One** is to write our section coordinates as a function of $s$. This is called 'section parametrisation' and it is often the trickiest bit.
1) Choose a convenient origin for (X,Y), considering symmetries and any radii
2) Define the origin of "s" at a free edge, progressing CCW if possible
3) Split the section into straight lines and circular arcs, $i=1,..., n$
4) Use A-Level trigonometry and algebra to derive functions $^{i}X_{(s)}$, $^{i}Y_{(s)}$, $^{i}t_{(s)}$ (variable thickness) for each wall $i$, resetting the arc-length $s$ at the start of each wall.
