### Isomerism
We have previously talked about [[1) Introduction to Polymers#The different types of Hydrocarbons|Isomerism]] however there are in fact two different kinds:

**Stereoisomerism**
This is where the orientation of the atoms in space is different.

**Geometric Isomerism**
This is based on the relative position of atoms/groups, generally around double bonds.
### Crystalinity
Polymers can form crystalline, semi-crystalline, and amorphous phases. Due to the complexity of these structures, the degree of crystallinity varies.
The % crystallinity can be calculated using the following equation:
$$\%~Crystallinity=\frac{\rho_{c}(\rho_{s}-\rho_{a})}{\rho_{s}(\rho_{c}-\rho_{a})}\times 100$$
Where:
$$\begin{align*}
\rho_{s} &= \text{the density of the polymer}\\
\rho_{a} &= \text{the density of the amorphous form}\\
\rho_{c}&= \text{the density of the perfectly crystalline polymer}
\end{align*}$$
There are some ways to influence a high level of crystallinity:
- Structure and complexity:
	- Linear homopolymers are easier to crystallise
	- Polymers with irregular arrangements are often more amorphous
	- Polymers with bulky side chains are often more amorphous
- Rate of cooling/time: Slower cooling allows the chains to rearrange themselves and form better crystals.
#### The Chain-Folded Structure
Often the length/width of the crystal is smaller than the length of a single chain of the polymer due to the chain-folded structure.

Many bulk polymers, when crystallized from a melt, form a semicrystalline material with spherulites.  Spherulites consist of an aggregate of ribbon-like chain-folded crystallites (lamellae). Spherulites in polymers are analogue of grains in polycrystalline metals and ceramics.
These increase the crystallinity, density, tensile strength, young's modulus, etc. However they do decrease the ductility and increases brittleness.
