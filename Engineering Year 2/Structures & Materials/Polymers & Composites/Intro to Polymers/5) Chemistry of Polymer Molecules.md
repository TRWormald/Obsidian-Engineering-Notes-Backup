### Synthesis
There are two main mechanisms for polymer synthesis, *Addition/Chain Polymerisation*, and *Condensation Polymerisation.*
##### Addition/Chain Polymerisation
This is a reaction that produces a polymer by linking small, [[1) Introduction to Polymers#The different types of Hydrocarbons|unsaturated]] molecules called monomers together.
The first step is **Initiation**, this is where the *initiator* (peroxide) gains energy - breaking the covalent bonds between the oxygen atoms - forming *free radical initiators*:

This free radical then bonds to a monomer - "opening it up", resulting in an activated monomer:

The next step is **propagation**, where the activated monomer, bonds with another monomer, increasing the length of the chain:

Finally we reach the final step **termination**, this is where an activated monomer bonds with the chain, creating a terminated polymer chain.

##### Condensation Polymerisation
This is a reaction that joins monomers to form polymers, releasing a small molecule, usually water, as a by-product.
The first step is the same as addition polymerisation:
**Initiation**, this is where the *initiator* (peroxide) gains energy - breaking the covalent bonds between the oxygen atoms - forming *free radical initiators*:

However then a monomer reacts with the radical, producing a longer chain as well as a by-product:

### Repeat Units
All polymers are made out of common "Repeat Units", some of the most common/applicable to Aerospace are listed below:

### Average Molecular Weight
Since the length of polymer chains is not fixed, it can be difficult to calculate the molecular weight of it. Therefore we can instead use the average molecular weight. There are two ways to calculate the average molecular weight:

**The number average molecular weight**
This is calculated using the formula:
$$\bar{M}_{n}=\sum x_{i}M_{i}$$
Where $M_{i}$ is the mean (middle) molecular weight of size range $i$, and $x_{i}$ is the fraction of the total number of chains with the corresponding size range.

**The weight average molecular weight**
This is calculated using the formula:
$$\bar{M}_{w}=\sum w_{i}M_{i}$$
Where $M_{i}$ is the mean molecular weight within a size range, and $w_{i}$ is the weight fraction of molecules in the same size interval.
### Polymerisation
The **degree of polymerisation** (DP) represents the average number of repeat units in a chain.
It can be calculated using the equation:
$$DP=\frac{\bar{M}_{n}}{m}=\frac{\text{number average molecular weight}}{\text{molecular weight of repeat unit}}$$

The graph above shows the distribution of molecular weights for a typical polymer.
### Functionality, Homopolymers, and Copolymers
**Functionality** is a property of a polymer, representing the number of active bonds of a monomer (or repeating unit) in it.
**Homopolymers** are polymers which are made of the same repeating units.
**Copolymers** are polymers which are made of two or more types of monomers.
#### Different Types of Copolymers
There are 4 main different types of copolymers, random, alternate, block, and graft, all can be seen below:
