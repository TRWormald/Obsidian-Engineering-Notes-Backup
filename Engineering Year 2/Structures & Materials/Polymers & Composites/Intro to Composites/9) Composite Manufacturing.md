There are two main methods of manufacturing composites:
1) Pre-preg
2) Lay up
### Pre-Preg Production
This is where continuous-fibre reinforcement is pre-impregnated with a thermoset polymer resin that is only partly cured. The pre-preg can be moulded into the desired shape and then cured fully.
- Prepregs are stored at low temperature, as they can cure at room temperature
- The time exposed to room temperature is also minimised
- If handled properly, most thermoset pre-pregs can have a lifetime of six months or longer.
#### Pulltrusion
This method of composite manufacturing is where continuous-fibre rovings, or tows, are impregnated with a thermosetting resin. They are then pulled through a steel die that pre-forms to the desired shape and establishes the resin to fibre ratio. Finally they are passed through a curing die to cure and form the final shape.

#### Filament Winding
This is where reels of fibre are pulled through a resin bath, before being wound around a "mandrel" around which they are cured:![[Pasted image 20241119112233.png]]
The advantages of this process are:
- An excellent strength to weight ratio
- The final product has a good resin distribution
- High fibre volume is achievable
- Fibres can be oriented in the loading direction
- Process can be automated and cost savings can be achieved
However there are some disadvantages:
- There are a limited number of product shapes
- High cost of material
- Winding reverse curvature is not possible
### Lay up Manufacturing
This is where the fibres are pre-laid and then impregnated with plastic/resin. There are a number of different methods that follow this basic format:
#### Hand Lay-Up

This is where resin is poured over the reinforcement and then forced into matrix using a roller (by hand).
This process is:
- Flexible
- Able to produce large and complex items
- Able to be completed with minimal equipment
- Capable of having a low tooling cost
However:
- The process is labour intensive
- Only one tooled surface is obtained
- Quality is related to the skill of the operator
#### Spray Lay-Up

A slightly more advanced form of hand lay up:
- The equipment and tooling costs are still low
- The deposition rates are high
- There is a good versatility of part shape and laminate configuration, including local thickness variations
However:
- Product quality is dependent on operator expertise
- There is some difficulty in removing trapped air from the moulding
#### Resin Transfer Moulding

Advantages:
- Good surface finish achieved
- Complex 3D shapes can be produced
- Greater reproducibility
- Production cycles are much faster than with standard lay-ups
Disadvantages
- Expensive tooling
- Size limits
- Edges tend to be resin rich
#### Vacuum Bagging
