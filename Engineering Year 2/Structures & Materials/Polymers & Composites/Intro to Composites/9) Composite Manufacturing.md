There are two main methods of manufacturing composites:
1) Pre-preg
2) Lay up
### Pre-Preg Production
This is where continuous-fibre reinforcement is pre-impregnated with a thermoset polymer resin that is only partly cured. The pre-preg can be moulded into the desired shape and then cured fully.
- Prepregs are stored at low temperature, as they can cure at room temperature
- The time exposed to room temperature is also minimised
- If handled properly, most thermoset pre-pregs can have a lifetime of six months or longer.
#### Pulltrusion
This method of composite manufacturing is where continuous-fibre rovings, or tows, are impregnated with a thermosetting resin. They are then pulled through a steel die that pre-forms to the desired shape and establishes the resin to fibre ratio. Finally they are passed through a curing die to cure and form the final shape.

#### Filament Winding
This is where reels of fibre are pulled through a resin bath, before being wound around a "mandrel" around which they are cured:![[Pasted image 20241119112233.png]]
