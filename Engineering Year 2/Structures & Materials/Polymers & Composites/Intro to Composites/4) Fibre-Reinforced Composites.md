These types of composites are highly technologically important, they are used widely in the aerospace sector where high *specific strength* and *modulus* are required.
$$\text{specific strength}=\frac{\text{ultimate tensile strength }\sigma_{ut}}{\text{specific gravity }\rho}$$
$$\text{specific modulus}=\frac{\text{modulus of elasticity } E}{\text{specific gravity } \rho}$$
### Matrix Materials
Typically in fibre-reinforced composites we use one of two different types of thermoset resin:
- Unsaturated polyester
- Epoxy

From this we can see that the mechanical properties of the fibre reinforced composites heavily depend on the alignment direction and composition of the fibres, as the matrix is not strong in and of itself.
