In particle-reinforced composites the matrix transfers some of the load to the particles and vice versa. They provide an increase in omni-directional strength, however it may not be as large in a given direction as FRCs.

We can use the [[2) The Rule of Mixtures|Rule of Mixtures]] to determine the mechanical properties for them.
