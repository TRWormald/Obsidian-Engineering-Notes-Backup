We can also make composites on a "macro" scale, using materials and other composites to create a stronger result:
##### Laminar Composites
These composites are multi-layered plies or laminates which are oriented to optimise strength, they are widely used in the aerospace, automotive, marine, and civil-infrastructure sectors.

##### Sandwich Panels
These composites are formed of two outer sheets separated by a thicker core, all bonded together using adhesive. The core material is lightweight and normally has a lower modulus of elasticity.
