Determining the mechanical properties of a composite can be quite difficult without experimental results, however we can use the rule of mixtures to determine an upper and lower bound for particle reinforced composites:
$$E_{c}(u)=E_{m}V_{m}+E_{p}V_{p}$$
$$E_{c}(l)=\frac{E_{m}E_{p}}{V_{m}E_{p}+V_{p}E_{m}}$$
Where $E$ is the elastic modulus, $V$ is the volume fraction, $_c$ represents the composite, $_m$ represents the matrix phase, and $_p$ represents the particulate phase.

This method works due to the uniform distribution of particulates throughout the composites, and therefore the ability to "average out" their material properties based on the volume fraction of each phase.
