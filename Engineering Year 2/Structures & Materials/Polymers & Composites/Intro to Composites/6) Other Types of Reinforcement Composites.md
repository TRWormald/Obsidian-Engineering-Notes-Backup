There are also a number of other reinforcement methods, some of which are discussed below:
#### Metal Matrix Composites
This is where there is a hard reinforcing phase (ceramic or man-made fibre) dispersed in a metal matrix; resulting in stiffer, harder, and stronger materials.
These have been used in fuselage struts in the Space Shuttle Orbiter, as well as helicopter blades.
#### Ceramic Matrix Composites
This is where ceramic reinforcement is embedded in a ceramic matrix. It is useful for high temperature applications, as well as when high strength and toughness is required.
They have been used in heat-shields for spacecraft, as well as brake disks.
#### Fibre-Metal Laminates
This is where t
