Nanocomposites are composites with dispersed nano-particles with the matrix most often being polymer.
They have exotic mechanical, electrical, magnetic, optical, thermal, biological, and transport properties.
Properties are interesting and different in nano-scale due to: (1) the increase in ratio of particle surface area to volume; and (2) particle size.
They are very much an emerging class of materials with lots of research being done into them at the moment.
##### Applications
There are many different applications to nanocomposites:
- Energy storage
- Gas barrier coating
- Flame-barrier coatings
- Mechanical strength enhancements
- Electrostatic dissipation
