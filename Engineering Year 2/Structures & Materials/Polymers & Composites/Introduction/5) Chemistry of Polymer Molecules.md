### Average Molecular Weight
There are two ways to calculate the average molecular weight:

**The number average molecular weight**
This is calculated using the formula:
$$\bar{M}_{n}=\sum x_{i}M_{i}$$
Where $M_{i}$ is the mean (middle) molecular weight of size range $i$, and $x_{i}$ is the fraction of the total number of chains with the corresponding size range.

**The weight average molecular weight**
This is calculated using the formula:
$$\bar{M}_{w}=\sum w_{i}M_{i}$$
Where $M_{i}$ is the mean molecular weight within a size range, and $w_{i}$ is the weight fraction of molecules in the same size interval.
