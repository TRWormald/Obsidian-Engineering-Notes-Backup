### Average Molecular Weight
There are two ways to calculate the average molecular weight:

**The number average molecular weight**
This is calculated using the formula:
$$\bar{M}_{n}=\sum x_{i}M_{i}$$
Where $M_{i}$ is the mean (middle) molecular weight of size range $i$, and $x_{i}$ is the fraction of hte total number of chains with the corresponding siz
