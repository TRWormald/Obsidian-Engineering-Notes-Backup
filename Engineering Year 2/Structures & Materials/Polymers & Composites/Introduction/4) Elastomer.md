These polymers are formed of linear coiled chains with limited covalent crosslinking between them.

These chains are coiled like a spring, allowing them to be stretched without being permanently deformed and then to 'spring' back.
They have the following properties:
- Very low stiffness
- Low strength
- Very high elasticity
- Excellent impact resistance
- Not easily recycled
