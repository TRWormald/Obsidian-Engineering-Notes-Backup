### Stress and Strain
Polymers experience stress and strain like all other materials, and the standard equations apply to them:
$$\text{Engineering Stress}=\sigma=\frac{F}{A_{0}}$$
$$\text{Engineering Strain}=\epsilon=\frac{l_{i}-l_{0}}{l_{0}}=\frac{\Delta l}{l_{0}}$$
$$\text{Hooke's Law: }\sigma=E\epsilon$$
