### Stress and Strain
Polymers experience stress and strain like all other materials, and the standard equations apply to them:
$$\text{Engineering Stress}=\sigma=\frac{F}{A_{0}}$$
$$\text{Engineering Strain}=\epsilon=\frac{l_{i}-l_{0}}{l_{0}}=\frac{\Delta l}{l_{0}}$$
$$\text{Hooke's Law: }\sigma=E\epsilon$$

On the graphs above we can see the Yield Strength $(\sigma_{y})$ along with the tensile strength $(TS)$, these are the points where prior to the point the material shows reversible deformation, and the stress at which fracture occurs respectively.

*How do metals and polymers compare based on their mechanical properties?*

| Property                   | Comparison                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modulus                    | Very high in metals vs very low in polymers                                               |
| Elongation                 | Metals rarely elongate >100%, whilst some polymers can elongate >1000%                    |
| Response to<br>Temperature | Mechanical properties of polymers are generally very sensitive to changes in temperature. |
### Stress-Strain Behaviour
There are three different types of stress-strain behaviours seen in polymers:

The macroscopic view would look something like this:

![[Pasted image 20241111184421.png|centre]]
Note how initially the crystalline regions stay together with the amorphous polymer stretching (something indicative of elastic behaviour), however as we increase the strain they break up (representing the plastic deformation).
#### Macroscopic view of Fracture
![[Pasted image 20241111184620.png|centre]]
Initially strain relief is provided by the development of micro-voids, however eventually the fibrillar bridges break and a crack forms.
Crazing is followed by cracking in many thermoplastics leading to fracture - however a craze can still support a load across its face, unlike a crack.
### Viscoelasticity
This property is observed in amorphous polymers. They are brittle at low temperatures, followed by a rubbery, viscous, and liquid like form.
At intermediate temperature the polymer shows combined characteristic properties of the two extremes, known as viscoelasticity.
**Viscoelastic Relaxation Modulus**
$$E_{r}(t) =\frac{\sigma(t)}{\epsilon_{0}}$$
So the relaxation modulus is time dependent, and decreases over time due to the relaxation of the polymer molecules.

### Other Mechanical Properties
##### Viscoelastic Creep
Weakening/deformation of polymer over time under constant stress. As a general rule, higher the degree of crystallinity, lower the susceptibility to creep.
##### Fracture of Polymers
Fracture strengths of most polymer are much lower compared to most metals. Heavily depends on how brittle/ductile the polymer is (therefore, depends on the temperature). Brittle below the glass transition temperature.
##### Impact Strength
Degree of resistance to impact. Temperature dependent. Decreases gradually in general with higher temperature, as polymer softens.
##### Fatigue
Failure under recurring/cyclic loading. Similar to metals, fatigue occurs at stress levels which is below the yield strength.
### Factors that Influence the Mechanical Properties of Semicrystalline Polymers
There are several factors that can affect the mechanical properties of polymers, some are listed below:
1) Molecular Weight
Tensile strength is a function of number-average molecular weight. This is due to greater chain entanglements with higher molecular weights of the polymer.
2) Degree of Crystallinity
Degree of crystallinity increases the secondary intermolecular interactions, and therefore, have significant influence on mechanical properties.
3) Pre-deformation by Drawing
The material strength is sometime improved by deformation of the polymer by stretching (drawing). 
- Alignment of the molecules as shown in earlier image (for stepwise deformation). 
- Tensile strength along the drawing is increased, 
- TS perpendicular to the alignment is reduced.
4) Heat Treating
Heat treating/annealing can increase the degree of crystallinity (shrinkage in volume, in general).
