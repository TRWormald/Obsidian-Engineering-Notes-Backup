### Stress and Strain
Polymers experience stress and strain like all other materials, and the standard equations apply to them:
$$\text{Engineering Stress}=\sigma=\frac{F}{A_{0}}$$
$$\text{Engineering Strain}=\epsilon=\frac{l_{i}-l_{0}}{l_{0}}=\frac{\Delta l}{l_{0}}$$
$$\text{Hooke's Law: }\sigma=E\epsilon$$

On the graphs above we can see the Yield Strength $(\sigma_{y})$ along with the tensile strength $(TS)$, these are the points where prior to the point the material shows reversible deformation, and the stress at which fracture occurs respectively.

*How do metals and polymers compare based on their mechanical properties?*

| Property                   | Comparison                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modulus                    | Very high in metals vs very low in polymers                                               |
| Elongation                 | Metals rarely elongate >100%, whilst some polymers can elongate >1000%                    |
| Response to<br>Temperature | Mechanical properties of polymers are generally very sensitive to changes in temperature. |
### Stress-Strain Behaviour
There are three different types of stress-strain behaviours seen in polymers:

The macroscopic view would look something like this:

Note how initially the crystalline regions stay together with the amorphous polymer stretching (something indicative of elastic behaviour), however as we increase the strain they break up (representing the plastic deformation).
#### Macroscopic view of Fracture
![[Pasted image 20241111184620.png|centre]]
Initially strain relief is provided by the development of micro-voids, however eventually the fibrillar bridges break and a crack forms.
Crazing is followed by cracking in many thermoplastics leading to fracture - however a craze can still support a load across its face, unlike a crack.
