### Isomerism
We have previously talked about [[1) Introduction to Polymers#The different types of Hydrocarbons|Isomerism]] however there are in fact two different kinds:

**Stereoisomerism**
This is where the orientation of the atoms in space is different.

**Geometric Isomerism**
This is based on the relative position of atoms/groups, generally around double bonds.
### Crystalinity
Polymers can form crystalline, semi-crystalline, and amorphous phases. Due
