### Synthesis
There are two main mechanisms for polymer synthesis, *Addition/Chain Polymerisation*, and *Condensation Polymerisation.*
##### Addition Polymerisation
This is a reaction that produces a polymer by linking small, [[1) Introduction to Polymers#The different types of Hydrocarbons|unsaturated]] molecules called monomers together.
The first step is **Initiation**, this is where the *initiator* (peroxide) gains energy - breaking the covalent bonds between the oxygen atoms - forming *free radical initiators*:

This free radical then bonds to a monomer - "opening it up", resulting in an activated monomer:

The next step is **propagation**, where the activated monomer, bonds with

### Average Molecular Weight
There are two ways to calculate the average molecular weight:

**The number average molecular weight**
This is calculated using the formula:
$$\bar{M}_{n}=\sum x_{i}M_{i}$$
Where $M_{i}$ is the mean (middle) molecular weight of size range $i$, and $x_{i}$ is the fraction of the total number of chains with the corresponding size range.

**The weight average molecular weight**
This is calculated using the formula:
$$\bar{M}_{w}=\sum w_{i}M_{i}$$
Where $M_{i}$ is the mean molecular weight within a size range, and $w_{i}$ is the weight fraction of molecules in the same size interval.
