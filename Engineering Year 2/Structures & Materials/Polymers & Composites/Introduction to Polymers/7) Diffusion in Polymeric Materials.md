Permeation of a polymer depends on the ease of a foreign substance diffuse through the material.
Penetration of foreign substances can often damage and degrade mechanical properties of materials (such as embrittlement of hydrogen tanks).
Diffusion is better through amorphous region compared to crystalline phases â€“ analogous to interstitial diffusion in crystalline solid, with smaller substances diffusing faster.

Diffusion properties of polymers are often characterised by the permeability coefficient ($P_{M}$), which is related to the diffusion flux ($J$) by:
$$J=-P_{M}\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x}$$
Where $\Delta P$ is the difference in pressure of the gas across the membrane, and $\Delta x$ is the membrane thickness.
For small molecules in non-glassy polymers, the permeability coefficient can be approximated as the product of the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the solubility of the diffusing species in the polymer $S$.
