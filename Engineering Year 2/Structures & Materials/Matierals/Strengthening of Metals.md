Strengthening means increasing the yield or ultimate strength of the metal, usually by impeding the movement of dislocations within the material.
We focus on the following strengthening mechanisms:
- Strain hardening (cold working)
- Grain boundary strengthening
- Dispersion strengthening
- Solid solution strengthening
- Precipitation hardening
	- Guinier-Preston zone strengthening
	- Coherent precipitate strengthening
	- Incoherent precipitate strengthening
### Strain Hardening
This consists of plastically deforming the material at near ambient temperatures, which drastically increases dislocation density.
Dislocations form at grain boundaries, free surfaces and second phase particles.
These dislocations then interact and impede each others movements.
**This increases yield strength and ultimate tensile strength but reduces ductility and elongation to failure.**

### Grain Boundary Strengthening
If the mismatch angles between neighbouring
grains are large then dislocations will arrest and "pile up" at the grain boundary.
Repulsive strain fields generated by each dislocation then build up, until enough energy exists for the dislocation to move across.
By reducing grain sizes we increase the density of grain boundaries, hence increasing the strength of the material.

### Dispersion Strengthening
This consists of dispersing small and strong ceramic oxide particles within the metallic matrix. The particles disrupt slip planes, impeding dislocation motion, and as Frank-Read sources generate concentric dislocation loops, which in turn increase the repulsive strain fields around particles.

### Solid Solution Strengthening
Adding alloying elements to occupy interstitial or substitutional sites distorts the lattice and resists dislocation movement. When atomic sizes are similar ($\pm 15$%) substitution will occur, otherwise alloying elements will occupy an interstitial site.
The level of strengthening depends on atomic size mismatch and content.

### Precipitation Strengthening
This is where hard precipitate particles are formed which resist dislocation slip, it is used in aluminium, titanium, magnesium, nickel and steel alloys.
Steps:
1) Solution treatment: heat metal until alloying elements are fully dissolved
2) Quenching: rapid cooling (in water or oil) fir supersaturated solid solution
3) Ageing: heat to intermediate temperatures to precipitate dispersed particles.

There are several mechanisms involved:

**Guinier-Preston Zone Strengthening**
This is where small clusters of atoms of alloying elements form with the same crystal structure as the base metal which resist dislocation motion.

**Coherent Precipitate Strengthening**
Precipitates develop when the local concentration of alloying elements matches that of another phase. The particles are coherent (i.e. there are no clear boundaries) with the host metal and and resist dislocation slip. The greater the concentration the greater the strength increase.
**Incoherent Precipitate Strengthening**
The crystal structure of precipitates change, resulting in discrete interfaces appearing. Dislocation cannot cross interfaces, leading to Orowan hardening.
Peak strength happens at transition from coherent, as incoherent particles grow, their spacing increases which decreases Orowan hardening and strength.
