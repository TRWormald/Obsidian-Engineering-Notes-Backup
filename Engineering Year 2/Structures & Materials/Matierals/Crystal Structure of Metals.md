Metals are formed of a repeating lattice pattern of atoms. There are three main unit cell patterns which we will consider: body centred cubic, face centred cubic, and hexagonal close packed. These can be seen in the diagram below:

These patterns are repeated over single crystals within the material.
### Defects in Crystal Structures
Crystal structures are not perfect, they contain defects which can result in the material properties changing.
#### Point Defects
There are several different types of point defects:
- Vacancies
	This is where one of the atoms in the lattice is missing (vacant) resulting in a strained lattice region around it.
- Interstitial Defects
	This is where there is an additional atom within the lattice that isn't supposed to be there, resulting in a strained lattice region around it.
- Substitution
	Substitution comes in two forms, when an atom in the lattice is replaced by a smaller atom and when it is replaced with a larger atom.
	Both cases strain the lattice structure, but in opposite directions.

#### Dislocation Defects
Dislocation is atomic disruption along a plane of the atomic lattice. There are two main types:
1) Edge dislocation where there is an extra lattice plane that doesn't extend the full thickness of the crystal:

2) Screw dislocation where one half of a crystal is slid across the other half along a lattice plane, resulting in a spiral stacking of crystal planes around the centre line:

#### Burgers Vector
The Burgers vector is a vector, often denoted as b, that represents the magnitude and direction of the lattice distortion resulting from a dislocation in a crystal lattice.

In the diagram above we can see the burgers vector for both edge and screw dislocation.
### Dislocation Slip
Dislocations will only move if:
- The applied stress is greater than the yield stress of the crystal (plastic deformation)
- The applied stress is lower than this yield stress, but it is sustained over long periods of time and/or at high temperatures (creep deformation)
This movement is called dislocation slip.
#### Slip Planes
Each crystal structure has a given number of possible slip planes:

More slip planes give better strain hardening.
Note that dislocations will slip more easily (i.e. at lower energy levels) along planes of greater atomic packing.
### Grain Boundaries
Most metals are polycrystalline, i.e. the crystal structure is "perfect" only within each grain.
Lattice axes are misaligned between neighbouring grains, i.e. across grain boundaries.
### Grain Boundaries vs. Dislocations
Grain boundaries impede dislocation motion, affecting material strength, ductility, creep behaviour etc.
In terms of dislocation slip we define two types of boundaries:
