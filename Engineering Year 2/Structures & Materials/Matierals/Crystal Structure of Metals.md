Metals are formed of a repeating lattice pattern of atoms. There are three main unit cell patterns which we will consider: body centred cubic, face centred cubic, and hexagonal close packed. These can be seen in the diagram below:

These patterns are repeated over single crystals within the material.
### Defects in Crystal Structures
Crystal structures are not perfect, they contain defects which can result in the material properties changing.
#### Point Defects
There are several different types of point defects:
- Vacancies
	This is where one of the atoms in the lattice is missing (vacant) resulting in a strained lattice region around it.
- Interstitial Defects
	This is where there is an additional atom within the matrix that
