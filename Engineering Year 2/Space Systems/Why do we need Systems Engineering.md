***Modern engineering systems are too complex for one person to keep all of the detail and understanding of how they work in their head!***

As a result we must share this cognitive load amongst ourselves in teams.
The diagram below shows how decisions that we make early in the design process will propagate through to millions of individual components.

The problem with this is that if incorrect decisions are made it can result in the downfall of a project due to the increased cost of redesign, as seen in the following diagram:

Up to 70& of costs are "locked in" by the end of the design process and if we have to redesign in the development phase as a result of a bad decision it could cost up to 100 times more as a result of the money already invested.

##But what kind of mistakes can lead to these massive costs?
