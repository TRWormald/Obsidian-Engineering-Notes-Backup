We have previously looked at how to decompose a system need into a set of requirements and a Functional Flow Block Diagram. Consequentially, we shouldn't be surprised to find that these are the sources we use to define our architecture.
The first iteration of constructing a system architecture should try to achieve a 1:1 mapping of functions to a sub-system/component element:

This means an architecture is finally starting to define HOW our system will satisfy the system need.
### Derived Requirements
As we go through the definition of a system architecture, we will start to mak
