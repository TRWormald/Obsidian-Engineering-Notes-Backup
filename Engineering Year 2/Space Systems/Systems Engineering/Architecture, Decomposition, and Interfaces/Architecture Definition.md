So far we have identified what our system must do and how well it must do it, and identified how much of a given resource or physical quantity it might have to have to carry out its mission.
The missing link between these steps and detailed design is the definition of the System Architecture.
Once a system architecture is defined it should look something like this:
![[Pasted image 20241012171321.png|centre|600]]
Which is:
- Functionally-Focused
	- It shows what system elements are required to carry out functions to satisfy system need
	- It is not a detailed design of components and systems
- Abstract/Icon Representation
	- It relied heavily on icons or abstract representations of the sub-system and components we wish to depict.
	- We may even just rely on labelled black boxes
- Interfaces
	- The final aspect of the system architecture in figure 17 is that it shows the interfaces between sub-system elements.
### System Architecture Definition
  Therefore we can see that a system architecture is a depiction of our system design that aims to highlight what system/sub-system elements we need based upon their function, but also the interfaces between them.
  **The INCOSE definition for System Architectures provides a really nice framework for creating system architectures:**
 **A System Architecture is the selection of the types of system elements, their characteristics and their arrangement, to meet the following criteria:**
1) **Satisfies the requirements** 
2) **Implements the functional architecture** 
3) **Acceptably close to optimum, within constraints of time, budget and knowledge**
4) **Consistent with the technical maturity and risks of selected elements**
