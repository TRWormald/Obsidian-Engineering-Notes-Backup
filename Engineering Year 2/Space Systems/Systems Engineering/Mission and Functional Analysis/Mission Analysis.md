***How do we know what our system must do?***
Mission analysis requires us to explore how the mission and system operation will unfold in its entirety from start to finish. In doing so, we will identify the useful aspects of our system which can be used as iterative feedback through the V-model to better define the system need and requirements.
It can help us to identify:
1) The sequence or schedule in which things must happen within the mission
2) Other systems outside of our system boundary that are required to complete the mission
3) System contingency in off-nominal conditions
