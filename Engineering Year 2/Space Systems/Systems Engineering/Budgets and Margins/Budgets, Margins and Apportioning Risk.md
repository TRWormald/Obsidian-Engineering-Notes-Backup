"Constraints" are requirements that dictate how much of a given quantity our systems will have. Some examples of constraints include, but are not limited to:
- Physical Size
- Mass
- Time
- Available Power
- Fuel/Propellant
- Cost
- Data Transmission Rates
**In fact, any quantitative aspect of our system is likely to be constrained!**
### Engineering Budgets
A budget is effectively the sum of elements within our system that will be constrained by an aspec
