We can define a position in 2 different ways:
1) Using a position vector: $r_x,~r_y,~r_z$ in m and $v_{x},~ v_{y},~v_{z}$
2) 6 Orbital/Keplerian Elements:
	1) Semi-major axis $a$
	2) Eccentricity $e$
	3) Inclination $i$
	4) Right ascension of the ascending node $\Omega$
	5) Argument of Periapsis $\omega$
	6) True or mean anomaly $v$ or $\theta$ or $M$

**Lets explore what all of these are:**
###### Semi-Major Axis
This is a measure of the size of the orbit.
###### Inclination
Inclination determines the northern and southern latitude limits.
It is the angle measured from a reference plane to the plane of orbit of the satellite, measured at the ascending node (i.e. the location where the satellite transits from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere) - hence its value will be between 0 and 180 degrees.
*Note that it is possible to determine the inclination of an orbit from the ground trace.*

Orbits with zero inclination are equatorial
Orbits with 90 degrees of inclination are polar orbits

**Ground Tracks or Traces**
Any inclined orbits will experience orbital progression, i.e. the earth rotates underneath the satellite meaning that it doesn't always cover the same area.
The only way to prevent this is through the use of a geostationary orbit - which by definition is equatorial.

The ground track of this inclined orbit shows that the satellite is moving "west", this is because the earth is rotating "eastwards".
###### Eccentricity
Eccentricity is effectively a measure of how circular an orbit is - i.e. a perfectly circular orbit will have an eccentricity of 0 whilst a larger $e$ value will result in an elliptical orbit.
*Note that an $e$ value equal to one results in a parabolic orbit (or more specifically a gravity assist) whilst if its more than one its a hyperbola.*
###### Ascending Node
The ascending node is the point where the spacecraft passes UP (ascends) through a reference plane.
The descending node is where the spacecraft passes DOWN (descends) through a reference plane.
**180 degrees after the ascending node the satellite has a descending node.** 
\
**The ascending node must be located using some non-moving reference point.**
This is where we get the "Right Ascension of Ascending Node $\Omega$" from.
It is also sometimes known as the "Longitude of"
