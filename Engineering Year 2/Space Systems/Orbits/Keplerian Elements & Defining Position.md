We can define a position in 2 different ways:
1) Using a position vector: $r_x,~r_y,~r_z$ in m and $v_{x},~ v_{y},~v_{z}$
2) 6 Orbital/Keplerian Elements:
	1) Semi-major axis $a$
	2) Eccentricity $e$
	3) Inclination $i$
	4) Right ascension of the ascending node $\Omega$
	5) Argument of Periapsis $\omega$
	6) True or mean anomaly $v$ or $\theta$ or $M$

**Lets explore what all of these are:**
###### Semi-Major Axis
This is a measure of the size of the orbit.
###### Inclination
Inclination determines the northern and southern latitude limits.
It is the angle measured from a reference plane to the plane of orbit of the satellite, measured at the ascending node (i.e. the location where the satellite transits from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere) - hence its value will be between 0 and 180 degrees.
*Note that it is possible to determine the inclination of an orbit from the ground trace.*

Orbits with zero inclination are equatorial
Orbits with 90 degrees of inclination are polar orbits
