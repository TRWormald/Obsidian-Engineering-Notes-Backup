### Some Orbital Terminology
Orbits have some specific terminology to describe certain parts of them. The furthest point from the orbited body is called the **Apoapsis** whilst the closes point is called the **Periapsis**.
These terms are the general - non specific - descriptors, however there are some for specific bodies:
- Apogee/Perigee - Earth
- Apolune/Perilune - Moon
- Apohelion/Perihelion - Sun
### Definition of an Orbit
An orbit is a closed or recurring path that a spacecraft or other body follows around another body.
All orbits have an eccentricity (which is also a property of ellipses) which describes it:
- For e<1 the orbit is closed with a recurring path (elliptical)
- For e>1 it is not an orbit - merely a passing trajectory (hyperbolic)
- For e=0 the orbit is circular
- For e=1 it is parabolic
