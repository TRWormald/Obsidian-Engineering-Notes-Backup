### Some Orbital Terminology
Orbits have some specific terminology to describe certain parts of them. The furthest point from the orbited body is called the **Apoapsis** whilst the closes point is called the **Periapsis**.
These terms are the general - non specific - descriptors, however there are some for specific bodies:
- Apogee/Perigee - Earth
- Apolune/Perilune - Moon
- Apohelion/Perihelion - Sun
### Definition of an Orbit
An orbit is a closed or recurring path that a spacecraft or other body follows around another body.
All orbits have an eccentricity (which is also a property of ellipses) which describes it:
- For e<1 the orbit is closed with a recurring path (elliptical)
- For e>1 it is not an orbit - merely a passing trajectory (hyperbolic)
- For e=0 the orbit is circular
- For e=1 it is parabolic (parabolas are special cases of hyperbolas)

### Ellipse Expressions
$$\text{Periapsis Distance}~~~~~~~~r_{p}=a(1-e)$$
$$\text{Apoapsis Distance}~~~~~~~~r_{a}=a(1+e)$$
$$\text{Semi-major Axis}~~~~~~~~a=(r_{a}+r_{p})/2$$
$$\text{Semi-Minor Axis}~~~~~~~~b=a\sqrt{1-e^{2}}$$
$$\text{Eccentricity}~~~~~~~~e=\frac{r_{a}-r_{p}}{r_{a}+r_{p}}$$
$$\text{Area of Ellipse}~~~~~~~~A=\pi ab$$
$$\text{Equation of Ellispse}~~~~~~~~ \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$$
### The Sidereal vs Solar/Synodic Day
One solar day is the time taken for the Sun to come back to the same place - 24hrs
