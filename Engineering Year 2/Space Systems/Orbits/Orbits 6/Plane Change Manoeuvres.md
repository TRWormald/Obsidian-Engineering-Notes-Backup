For no other elements to change, the burn must take place where the initial and target planes intersect (the nodes).
Even a small amount of plane change requires **lots** of delta V.
Less delta V is required at higher altitudes. Due to the lower velocity at higher altitudes, it can be more efficient to boost to a higher altitude, do the plane change and then drop back down to a lower altitude..
These manoeuvres are often combined with Hohmann transfers or rendezvous manoeuvres.
### Calculations
In a "simple" plane change the magnitude of V remains constant.

$$\Delta V=2V\sin\left(\frac{\Delta i}{2}\right)$$
