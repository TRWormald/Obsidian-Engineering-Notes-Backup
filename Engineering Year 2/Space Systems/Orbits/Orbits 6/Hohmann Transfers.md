A Hohmann transfer is the most efficient way to increase or decrease your orbital altitude.
Its mostly used with coplanar circular orbits.
It consists of two burns, one at the periapsis to increase the apoapsis, and another at the apoapsis to "circularise".

The time of flight is half the period of the orbit:
$$TOF=\frac{T_{trans}}{2}$$
$$T_{trans}=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\mu}}a_{trans}^\frac{3}{2}$$
And we are able to calculate the period from Kepler's 3rd Law.
