We have derived the Vis-Viva equation to calculate velocities for circular, elliptical and parabolic orbits:
$$\varepsilon=\frac{1}{2}v^{2}- \frac{\mu}{r}$$
We have also derived the Kepler Equation:
$$M=n(t-t_{0})=E-e\sin E$$
$$\tan \frac{\theta}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}\tan \frac{E}{2}~~~~~~~~n=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a^{3}}}$$
We know that bonus $\Delta V$ due to Earth's rotation is worth up to 0.5km/s, and that launch losses can be due to gravity, drag, and steering losses.
### Orbital Manoeuvres
There are a few types or orbital manoeuvres:
1) Launch
2) In-plane (a change in $a$)
3) Out-of-plane (a change in $i$, $\Omega$, or $\omega$ )
These lead to:
- **Hohmann Transfers**
- Fast Transfers
- Spiral Transfers
- **Rendezvous**
- Gravitational Assists
Of which the ones in bold we will be considering.
### General Principals of Manoeuvres
1) Burning prograde increases $a$
2) Burning retrograde decreases $a$
3) Initial and final orbits intersect at a point where impulse is applied
4) You need to get to the right point at the right time
5) Separate manoeuvres may be combined vectorially
6) All in plane manoeuvres should be done at periapsis or apoapsis (it's most efficient)
### Changing Orbit Altitudes
We know that orbital energy can be calculated (for circular orbits) using the equation:
$$E=- \frac{GMm}{2r}$$
Therefore if we want to increase our orbital height from $r_{1}$ to $r_{2}$ then:
$$E_{2}-E_{1}=\Delta E=- \frac{GMm}{2r_{2}}+ \frac{GMm}{2r_{1}}$$
