We have derived the Vis-Viva equation to calculate velocities for circular, elliptical and parabolic orbits:
$$\varepsilon=\frac{1}{2}v^{2}- \frac{\mu}{r}$$
We have also derived the Kepler Equation:
$$M=n(t-t_{0})=E-e\sin E$$
$$\tan \frac{\theta}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}\tan \frac{E}{2}~~~~~~~~n=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a^{3}}}$$
We know that bonus $\Delta V$ due to Earth's rotation is worth up to 0.5km/s, and that launch losses can be due to gravity, drag, and steering losses.
### Orbital Manoeuvres
There are a few types or orbital manoeuvres:
1) Launch
2) In-plane (a change in $a$)
3) Out-of-plane (a change in $i$, $\Omega$, or $\omega$ )
These lead to:
- **Hohmann Transfers**
- Fast Transfers
- Spiral Transfers
- Rendezvous
- Gravitational Assists
