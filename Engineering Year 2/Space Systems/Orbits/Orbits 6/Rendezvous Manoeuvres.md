The steps are:
1) Launch into an orbit with similar plane
2) Match inclination at nodes
3) Move the apoapsis of your orbit to the target orbit
4) Change your periapsis to match the target orbit. You should not be in the same orbit but out of phase
5) Use Hohmann to change phase (co-orbital rendezvous)
6) Last 50m done at very low velocities.
