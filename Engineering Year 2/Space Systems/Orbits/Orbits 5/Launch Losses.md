Large impulses take finite time, so extra propellant is needed to counteract gravity losses.
Atmosphere means we need to go up before we go horizontally to minimise drag losses.
We also get steering losses due to the axis of the rocket not being aligned with V.

The rotational velocity of the earth at the launch site will give the launch vehicle a valuable extra increment (or undesirable decrement if the required orbit is retrograde) of velocity. Since this effect is greatest at low geographic latitudes it is desirable to launch as near to the equator as possible.
The speed of the equatorial points can be calculated as around 465m/s.
