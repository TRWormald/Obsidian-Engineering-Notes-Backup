We have previously derived the [[The Kepler Problem#Equation of Motion for 2 body system|Orbit Equation]]:
$$r(\theta)=\frac{h^{2}/\mu}{1+e\cos(\theta-\omega)}$$
However it would be nice to find an expression for $r(t)$ and the easiest way to do this is by solving geometrically by introducing the concept of Eccentric anomaly $E$ and mean motion $n$.
