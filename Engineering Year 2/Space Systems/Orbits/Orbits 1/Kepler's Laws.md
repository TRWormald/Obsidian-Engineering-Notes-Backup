### Kepler's First Law
In his First Law, Kepler states that all the orbits of planets are elliptical with the Sun located at one of the foci.
An ellipse consists of two foci, a semi-major axis and a semi-minor axis:

A circle is just an ellipse where the eccentricity is zero - i.e. when the two foci are located in exactly the same place.
### Kepler's Second Law
In his Second Law, Kepler states that the line joining a planet to the sun sweeps out an equal area in equal intervals of time.
This means that when bodies are further away from the sun they are travelling slower and when they are closer they travel faster.
### Kepler's Third Law
In his Third Law, Kepler states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This results in the equation:
$$\frac{T^{2}}{a^{3}}=Constant$$
$$\frac{T_{1}^{2}}{T_{2}^{2}}=\frac{a_{1}^{3}}{a_{b}^{3}}$$
