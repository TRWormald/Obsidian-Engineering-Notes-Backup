*In classical mechanics, the Kepler problem is to find the position and speed of two bodies over time given their masses, initial positions and velocities. The solution allowed scientists to show that planetary motion could be explained by classical mechanics and Universal Law of gravitation.*

The Kepler problem consists of to determinging the radial and angular coordinates, of an object in a Keplerian orbut around the Sun as a function of time.
$\vec{v}_{r}$ is the radial velocity and $\vec{v}_{\theta}$ is the angular velocity. They are perpendicular:

We use conservation of angular momentum to show that the motion is planar:
For large $r$ and small $m$, we can write:
$$\vec{L}=\vec{r}\times\vec{p}$$
