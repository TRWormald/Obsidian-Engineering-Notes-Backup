### The Ecliptic
The Earth has an **axial tilt** of 23.5 degrees - this is the angle between the celestial equator and the ecliptic (the plane in which we orbit):

We need to fix a plane with repsect to a point, either with respect to the Earth or to the stars. e.g. we can use the prime meridian (Earth) or the First Point of Aries (stars). The vernal (Spring) equinox is the position of the Sun on March 21st when the Sun crosses the equator going from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere. The symbol of the ram indicates the First Point of Aries (the constellation). This point is one of two points on the Celestial Sphere where the Ecliptic and the Celestial Equator cross one another.

#### The Vernal Equinox and the First Point of Aries
When the sun passes over the equator moving south to north we have the **Vernal Equinox (March 21st)** at this point in time a vector points through earth to a fixed celestial point: **First Point of Aries**.

### Defining a Reference Frame
$X$ is in a reference direction such as the First Point of Aries, $Z$ is normal to the fundamental plane (either the ecliptic or the equatorial plane). $Y$ is the cross product (i.e. the normal to both of these directions):

### Earth Centred Reference Frames
#### Earth Centred Inertial (ECI)
- $\hat{x}$ = Reference direction = First point of Aries
- $\hat{y}$ = $\hat{z}\times\hat{x}$
- $\hat{z}$ = Normal to fundamental plane of equator/ecliptic
#### Earth Centred Earth Fixed (ECEF)
- $\hat{x}$ = Reference direction = Greenwich meridian
- $\hat{y}$ = $\hat{z}\times\hat{x}$
- $\hat{z}$ = Normal to fundamental plane of the equator

### Topocentric Horizon
The topocentric horizon system is used with telescopes and typically
