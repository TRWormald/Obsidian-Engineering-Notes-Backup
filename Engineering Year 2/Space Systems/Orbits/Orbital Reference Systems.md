### The Ecliptic
The Earth has an **axial tilt** of 23.5 degrees - this is the angle between the celestial equator and the ecliptic (the plane in which we orbit):

We need to fix a plane with repsect to a point, either with respect to the Earth or to the stars. e.g. we can use the prime meridian (Earth) or the First Point of Aries (stars). The vernal (Spring) equinox is the position of the Sun on March 21st when the Sun crosses the equator going from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere. The symbol of the ram indicates the First Point of Aries (the constellation). This point is one of two points on the Celestial Sphere where the Ecliptic and the Celestial Equator cross one another.
