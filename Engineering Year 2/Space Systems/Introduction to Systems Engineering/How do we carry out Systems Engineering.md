### The V-Model
All systems have a lifecycle, from the first observation of the problem to the final implementation of the solution to eventually retirement.
The V-Model walks us through this lifecycle rather neatly and is shown in the figure:

**But what are the key points of the V-Model?**
1) **Lifecycle**:
   All projects start with a *need*, a problem we want to solve. We must figure out what our system must do to solve this problem before we can start any design work.
   We then move onto what functions the system must perform to solve the problem.
   Design is the process of identifying *how* the system will achieve the functions.
   Once the system is designed we can begin to test it to see if it  achieves what we wanted and solves our original problem.
