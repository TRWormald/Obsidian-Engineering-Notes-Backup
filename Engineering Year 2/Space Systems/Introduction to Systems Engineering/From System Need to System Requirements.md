When developing an engineering solution it is our job as engineers to observe **needs** and then translate them into **requirements**.
Needs can come from several sources:
- Customer requests
- Internal failure
- Regulatory and political pressure
- etc.
### Why are Requirements Important?
The diagram below shows how we develop *needs* into *goals* and *objectives*:

#### Writing "Good" Requirements
There are several things that need to be present in a requirement for it to be considered "good":
1) Necessary to Satisfy System Need
2) Implementation Independent
3) Stated Explicitly and Positively (Shall)
4) Measurable and Verifiable
5) Traceable
6) Achievable
7) Language - Clear, Concise, and Unambiguous

### Verification vs Validation
When you *verify* a system you are checking to see if you have "built the system right" with regards to the requirements that we had at the start of the process.
In contrast, *validation* is asking the question "have we built the right system", this leads us to consider the original goal that we had and evaluating whether our system achieves that goal.
