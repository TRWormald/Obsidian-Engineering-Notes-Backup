### What are Payloads
The payload is the part of the mission architecture which fulfils the objectives of the mission, this can be to produce money (e.g. if the satellite was for communications) or carry out research.
### Spacecraft Architecture

The spacecraft consists of the Payload (as mentioned above) and the 'Bus' which is the rest of the craft, which is used for IOM (in orbit manoeuvring) and orientation control, potentially along with power delivery. 
 
### Instruments
Payloads often consist of instruments. A generic instrument consists of the following elements: One or more sensors or detectors, an electronics unit/s associated with the sensors which transform the basic physical parameters to be measured (e.g. magnetic fields, particle fluxes/energies etc.) into electrical signals, an onboard control and data processing unit (computer) which connects to the spacecraft transmitter/receiver.
### Types of Payloads
1) Passive Payloads
These receive and process data only.
2) Active Payloads
These provide their own means of sensing the subject, e.g. radar, and sensors then receive signals back to create data to analyse.

### Instrument Performance
There are several different ways in which we can measure the performance of an instrument:
1) Storage/Transmission of Data
2) Sensitivity or Signal/Noise
3) Spectral Band
4) Swath Width
5) Field of View
6) Coverage
7) Scanning Modes
8) Resolution
