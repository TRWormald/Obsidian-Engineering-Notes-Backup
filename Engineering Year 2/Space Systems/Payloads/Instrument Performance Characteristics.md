### Instrument Performance
There are several different ways in which we can measure the performance of an instrument:
1) Storage/Transmission of Data
2) Sensitivity or Signal to Noise Ratio
3) Spectral Band
4) Swath Width
5) Field of View
6) Coverage
7) Scanning Modes
8) Resolution

#### Spectral Band
This is just the area of the EM spectrum that the instrument is recording in, e.g. X-Ray, optical etc.

#### Swath
This is the path that the sensor looks at on the ground. It is measured across the path of the spacecraft, and this is called the 'swath width'. Its width is determined by the height of the orbit and the sensor field of view.

#### Field of View
The angular field of view (also field of vision, abb. FOV) is the extent of the observable world that is seen at any given moment. It is usually measured in degrees, radians, arcminutes, or arcseconds. FOV is dependant on focal length and detector size (with a large detector resulting in a wide FOV whilst a long focal length results in a narrow FOV).

#### Coverage
Footprint is defined as the shape of the area of the Earth which the satellite communicate with or observe at a moment in time. There is a different footprint for each transponder or communications transmitter. Coverage is defined as the total geographic area that the satellite can communicate with. Example: Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) provide continuous imagery and data on atmospheric conditions and solar activity (space weather) from Geostationary orbit. This allows them to be over one point on the Earth continuously.
