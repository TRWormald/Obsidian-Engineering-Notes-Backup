**Systems Engineering** - The process of creating complex engineering solutions to difficult to solve problems.
\
We break down the problem and system we intend to design into smaller parts (system elements/subsystems).
\
Subsystems are linked by interfaces.
\
Subsystems can also themselves be broken down into smaller pieces.
\
**Essentially we break down a problem into smaller and smaller pieces until they become easier to solve.**

### The Systems Model
As engineers, we naturally gravitate towards a hardware perspective of engineering systems (i.e. the ‘thing’ we can physically see). However, the secret to complex engineering systems is to view them from different abstractions or perspectives. We can convert any engineering artefact into a ‘black-box’ model.

The figure above shows the system model in a) abstract form and in b) one loosely based on Perseverance.

The important elements of a system model are:
- The **sub-elements** which are linked by **interfaces**
- The **system boundary** whc
