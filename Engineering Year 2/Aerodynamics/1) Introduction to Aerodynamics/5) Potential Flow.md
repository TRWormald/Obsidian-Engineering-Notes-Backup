Consider the special case of irrotational flow, this is a good approximation other than at the surface, and in the wake for lifting flows.
Irrotationality guarantees the existence of a scalar velocity potential function $\phi$ where:

If the flow is also incompressible - using the mass conservation equation applied to the velocity field defined by velocity potential yields:
$$\nabla^{2}\phi =\frac{\partial^{2}\phi}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}\phi}{\partial y^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}\phi}{\partial z^{2}}=0$$
Which is linear so the solutions can be superposed - and hence flow models can be built up from "elementary flow solutions".
*For compressible flows the equation is more complex and beyond the scope of the course.*

The energy equation doesn't need to be solved as for incompressible flow, the flow is assumed to be adiabatic and therefore the energy remains constant.
