It is more difficult to model unsteady flows, than steady ones - however some interesting unsteady flows can be modelled as steady flows if the fluid motion relative to a moving, rather than a fixed coordinate system, is considered using a [[Engineering Year 1/AVDASI/Aerodynamics/Potential Flow/The Galilean Transform|Galilean Transform]].

A common example of this is a plane travelling at cruise, if we model the system with a global coordinate system then the pressure at any point in space varies with time, however if we use a coordinate system based on the plane (moving with it) then the pressure at a given point in space about the plane is constant. This makes calculations far easier.
*Applied to the Navier-Stokes equations, the transformation changes the velocity by the constant relative motion of the aircraft but leaves the STATIC pressure and temperature unchanged.*
