##### What is the value of the Reynolds Number at 20$ms^{-1}$?
##### What is the value of the Mach Number at 20$ms^{-1}$?
##### What do the numbers in the NACA 23015 aerofoil designation mean?
##### How does flap deflection influence the maximum $C_{l}$ (the $C_{l}$ at stall)? Why might this be useful?
##### How does the flap deflection influence stall angle?
##### Illustrate with a diagram the regions of adverse and favourable pressure gradient. Will separation usually occur under an adverse or favourable pressure gradient?
##### Where does the flow first separate from the aerofoil? What type of stall is this? Is the stall gradual or sudden? What would happen for a thinner section?
##### How does the lift curve slope compare to the flat plate potential flow result of $2\pi$/radian? List three potential reasons for the difference.
##### Definition and usage of $C_{p}$
$$C_{p}=\frac{p-p_{\infty}}{\frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}}$$
##### Definition and Usage of $C_{l},~C_{m},~C_{d}$
$$\begin{bmatrix}C_{x}\\C_{y}\end{bmatrix}=\oint C_{p}\mathbf{n}~d\left(\frac{s}{c}\right)$$
Where $\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal.
$$\begin{bmatrix}C_{l}\\C_{d}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\cos(\alpha)&-\sin(\alpha)\\\sin(\alpha)&\cos(\alpha)\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}C_{x}\\C_{y}\end{bmatrix}$$
$$C_{m}=\oint C_{p}\mathbf{n}\times\mathbf{d}d\left(\frac{s}{c}\right)=\oint C_{p}\begin{bmatrix}\Delta y\\-\Delta x\end{bmatrix}\times\begin{bmatrix}x_\end{bmatrix}$$
