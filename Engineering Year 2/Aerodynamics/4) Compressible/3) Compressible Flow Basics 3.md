### Isentropic Relationships Between Pressure, Density and Speed
We can make the additional assumption of an isentropic process:
$$\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}=\left(\frac{\rho_{2}}{\rho_{1}}\right)^{\gamma}=\left(\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\right)^{\frac{{\gamma}}{\gamma-1}}$$
Which we can substitute into the total temperature equation to give:
$$p_{0}=p\left\{1+ \frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^{2}\right\}^ \frac{{\gamma}}{\gamma-1}$$
$$\rho_{0}=\rho\left\{1+ \frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^{2}\right\}^ \frac{{1}}{\gamma-1}$$
*The ratios $T_{0}/T$, $p_{0}/p$, and $\rho_{0}/\rho$ are given in compressible flow tables, so we use tables to solve most questions rather than the equations.*

## Choked Flow
### Recall - 1D Euler Equation
Recalling from earlier that we simplified the Navier-Stokes equations to obtain the steady Euler equations, and hence obtained that along a streamline:
$$dp=-\rho V~dV$$
### 1D Isentropic Duct Flow (or along a streamline)
Let's model flow in a duct with slowly changing area $A$, therefore:
- The angle
