### What is Compressibility
Compressibility is effectively where density is a function of pressure.

We can see how an increased Mach number changes the stagnation density (the density when the air is completely brought to a halt).

### Navier-Stokes
The Navier-Stokes equations in a fixed Cartesian coordinate system describe unsteady, viscous, compressible flow with body forces. In 3D there are 7 different unknown quantities, and the equations are:
- Conservation of Mass (1 eqn)
- Conservation of Momentum in each coordinate direction (3 eqn)
- Conservation of total Energy (1 eqn)
- Two equations that come from the fundamental properties of the fluid
These equations determine the behaviour of all the flow quantities such as density, the three components of velocity, temperature, pressure, energy, and viscosity.
### Conservation of Energy
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, merely changed in form
