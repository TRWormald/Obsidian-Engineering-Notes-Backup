### Last Time:
For adiabatic flow along a streamline - with no assumption on entropy:
$$h_{0}=h+ \frac{1}{2}V^{2}$$
$$C_{p}T_{0}=C_{p}T + \frac{1}{2}V^{2}$$
$$T_{0}=T\left(1+ \frac{(\gamma-1)M^{2}}{2}\right)$$
Note that the equation above is ADIABATIC, and therefore valid for use across shockwaves.
The we also looked at isentropic and non-isentropic cases, for isentropic flow $T_0$, $p_{0}$, and $\rho_{0}$ are all constant:
$$p_{0}=p\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^{2}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}$$
$$\rho_{0}=\rho\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}$$
Note that the two equations above are ISENTROPIC and therefore are not valid across shockwaves - only between them.
