### What Happens to Temperature Along a Stream-tube
A streamtube is defined by streamlines - with no flow normal to the streamlines the mass flow at 1 must equal the mass flow at 2:
$$\dot{m}=\rho_{1}A_{1}V_{1}=\rho_{2}A_{2}V_{2}$$
Then, with the following defined:
$$\text{Rate of KE entering}~~~~~~~~\frac{1}{2}\dot{m}v^{2}$$
