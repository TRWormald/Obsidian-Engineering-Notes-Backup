If two bodies are geometrically similar (i.e. the same shape but different sizes) then their flows will only be similar if the similarity parameters are the same.
These parameters are values that arise from dimensional analysis, and include the Reynolds Number, Coefficient of Pressure, Mach Number, etc.
Similar flows will have:
- The same streamlines
- The same plots throughout of flow quantities scaled by values in the far field e.g. velocity, pressure, density, temperature
- The same force coefficients
### The Pressure Coefficient
The pressure coefficient is the ratio of the pressure force to the inertia force:
$$C_{p}=\frac{\Delta p}{\frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}}=\frac{\text{pressure force}}{\text{inertia force}}$$
### The Reynolds Number
The Reynolds number is the ratio of the inertia force to the viscous force:
$$Re=\frac{\rho VL}{\mu}=\frac{VL}{\nu}=\frac{\text{inertia force}}{\text{viscous force}}$$
With a low Reynolds number viscous forces are important, however with high Reynolds numbers, viscous effects are confined to a thin region near the body.
