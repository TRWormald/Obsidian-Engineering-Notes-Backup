The Navier-Stokes equations in a fixed Cartesian coordinate system describe unsteady, viscous, compressible flow with body forces. The equations are:
- Continuity, conservation of mass (1 eqn)
- Conservation of Momentum in each coordinate direction (3 eqns)
- Conservation of total Energy (1 eqn)
- Two equations of state - i.e. the fundamental properties of the fluid. (We will typically use the Gas Law and a law related to Viscosity.)
### Calculating N-S Solutions
Numerically resolving all the detail of a N-S solution is not possible at Reynolds numbers typically found in aerodynamics - because of small eddies/turbulence. 
N-S solutions are not routinely calculated, even today - typically reserved for very specialist circumstances.

As a result we cant get analytical solutions, so we make series' of assumptions to simplify the equations. The first three are:
1) Viscous effects are negli
