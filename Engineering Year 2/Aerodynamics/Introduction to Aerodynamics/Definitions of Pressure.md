Last year we looked at flows of liquids and gases, however this year we are only concerned with air flows over wings/aerofoils.
**Due to the density of air being so small, pressure contributions due to hydrostatic effects can be neglected.**
Therefore we only need to know the difference between: **static pressure**, **total pressure**, and **dynamic pressure**.
### Bernoulli's Equation
With no body forces we can say that [[Bernoulli's Equation]] is:
$$p_{0}=p+ \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}$$
Where $p$ is the **static pressure** - i.e. the actual pressure of the fluid (caused by random movement of molecules), which is associated not with its motion but with its state. This can be measured using a barometer.
Where $p_{0}$ is the **total pressure** - also known as the reservoir, stagnation, or pitot pressure. The total pressure is the pressure when all kinetic energy is converted into pressure energy.
Where $\frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}$ is the **dynamic pressure** - which is equal to the difference between the total pressure and the static pressure.

**Note that this is for STEADY, INCOMPRESSIBLE flow.**
### Pressure Definitions in Steady, Compressible Flow
For steady compressible flow the equation relating static and total pressure is a bit more complicated due to variations in density.
**Static pressure** is again due to the random motion of molecules.
**Total pressure** is the pressure that would be experienced when the fluid is brought to rest isotopically.
