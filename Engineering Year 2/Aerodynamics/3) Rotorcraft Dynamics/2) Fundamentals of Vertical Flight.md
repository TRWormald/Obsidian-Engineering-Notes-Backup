We have previously looked at [[Actuator Disc Theory (Propellors)|actuator disk theory]].
The **lifting rotor** in its most simplistic form is a propeller: mechanical energy is used to accelerate a mass of air to generate a lifting force.
Newton's law, states that $F=ma$ where $F$ is the rotor thrust $T$.

In the above diagram we apply Bernoulli's equation to either side of the actuator disk to get:
$$H_{0}=P_{0}+ \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}=P_{1}+ \frac{1}{2}\rho (V+v)^{2}$$
$$H_{1}=P_{0}+ \frac{1}{2}\rho (V+v_{1})^{2}=P_{1}+P'+ \frac{1}{2}\rho (V+v)^2$$
Subtracting $H_{0}$ from $H_{1}$ results in:
$$H_{1}-H_{0}=\frac{1}{2}\rho(2Vv_{1}+v_{1}^{2})=P'$$
However, the Thrust is equal to the change in axial momentum per unit time:
$$\frac{T}{A}=P'=\rho(V+v)v_{1}$$
Which can be obtained from [[Control Volume Analysis Introduction|control volume analysis]]. Where $A$ is the rotor disc area.


Therefore we have:
