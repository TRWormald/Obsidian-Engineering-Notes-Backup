There are three main regimes in axial flight:
- Hover
- Climb
- Descent
We have [[2) Fundamentals of Vertical Flight#The Universal Induced Velocity Diagram|previously]] seen the "Universal Induced Velocity Diagram":

Which compares the normalised induced velocity $v$ to the normalised vertical velocity of the craft $V$.
### Axial Flow States
The vertical climb and hover states (and to a certain extent the slow descent) are easily analysed by momentum considerations, as already discussed.
Higher rates of descent can be problematic, both analytically (as the stream tube no longer exists) and in piloting the craft.
Following a total engine failure the helicopter pilot will descend the aircraft into the upper region of the turbulent wake state.

##### The Normal Working State
This is for when the rotor is in climb:
![[Pasted image 20250127154320.png|centre]]
This is for when the rotor is in hover:

##### Vortex Ring State
This is for when the rotor is in very slow descent:
![[Pasted image 20250127154448.png|centre]]
And when it is in slow descent:
![[Pasted image 20250127154525.png|centre]]
##### Turbulent Wake State
This is for when the rotor is in moderate descent:
![[Pasted image 20250127154627.png]]
*Also sometimes known as Ideal Autorotation*
This is for when the rotor is in high descent rate:
![[Pasted image 20250127154727.png]]
##### Windmill Brake State
This is when the rotor is in very high descent rate:
![[Pasted image 20250127154809.png|centre]]
And when it is in extreme descent rate:
![[Pasted image 20250127154833.png|centre]]
### Analysing Axial Flow States
The vertical climb and hover states are easily analysed by momentum considerations - and to a certain extent so can the slow descent states.

However higher rates of descent can be problematic, both in analysis and in piloting the craft.
We can summarise the data we've got in the Universal Induced Velocity Curve.
Note that the dark area is literally a "grey area" as it cannot be solved analytically, and therefore comprises of empirical results obtained by flight tests.
