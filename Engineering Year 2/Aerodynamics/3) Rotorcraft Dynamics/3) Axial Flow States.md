There are three main regimes in axial flight:
- Hover
- Climb
- Descent
We have [[2) Fundamentals of Vertical Flight#The Universal Induced Velocity Diagram|previously]] seen the "Universal Induced Velocity Diagram":

Which compares the normalised induced velocity $v$ to the normalised vertical velocity of the craft $V$.
### Axial Flow States
The vertical climb and hover states (and to a certain extent the slow descent) are easily analysed by momentum considerations, as already discussed.
Higher rates of descent can be problematic, both analytically (as the stream tube no longer exists) and in piloting the craft.
Following a total engine failure the helicopter pilot will descend the aircraft into the upper region of the turbulent wake state.
