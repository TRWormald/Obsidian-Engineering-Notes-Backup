Today we will be looking at:
- Maximising the Figure of Merit
- The Coning Angle
### Recap on Rotor Efficiency
We have previously looked at the efficiency of a rotor, we defined this as:
$$\eta_{rotor}=\frac{\text{Output Power}}{\text{Input Power}}$$
This is the same as the "Figure of Merit" that we explored [[4) Sustained Hover (1)|last time]].
$$\eta_{r}=FoM=\frac{P_{i}}{P}=\frac{Tv}{P}$$
We also previously saw that the "Figure of Merit" was equal to the Thrust Coefficient ($C_{T}$) divided by the Power Coefficient ($C_{P}$) multiplied by $\lambda$:
$$FoM=\frac{}{}$$
