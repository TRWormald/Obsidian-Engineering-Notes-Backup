A rotorcraft in translational flight (or Edge-Wise Flow) has to tilt itself forwards to use its lift force to accelerate it.
Therefore the lift force can be split into two components, one counteracting the weight and the other moving the rotorcraft forwards.

### The Rotor in Edge-Wise Flow
Let us consider the following rotor:

The above diagram shows the rotor in translational flight, including a flow component ($V$) due to this forward movement, which adds to the velocity due to rotation.
This results in a reverse flow region being formed, and hence the leading blade produces more lift, due to its greater relative velocity.
**i.e. resulting in lift asymmetry**
$$\mu=\frac{V}{\Omega R}$$
This lift asymmetry creates a rolling moment about the shaft, potentially resulting in the rotorcraft being uncontrollable.

The solution to this problem is effectively that you need to have a hinge at the root of a blade to relieve this rolling moment, by allowing the blades to flap.
### Blade Flapping Motion

In translational flight the blade will flap about the hinge.
The hinge allows no (or low) moment transfer to the rotor hub.

As the blade flaps up, the angle of incidence is reduced, and so therefore is the lift which tends to oppose the upwards flapping motion.
As the blade flaps down, the angle of incidence is increased and so therefore is the lift which tends to oppose the downward flapping motion.

All of this comes together to effectively promote the blade flapping motion.
