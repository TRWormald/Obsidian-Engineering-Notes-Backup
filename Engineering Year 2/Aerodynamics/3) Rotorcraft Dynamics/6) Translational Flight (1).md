A rotorcraft in translational flight (or Edge-Wise Flow) has to tilt itself forwards to use its lift force to accelerate it.
Therefore the lift force can be split into two components, one counteracting the weight and the other moving the rotorcraft forwards.

### The Rotor in Edge-Wise Flow
Let us consider the following rotor:

The above diagram shows the rotor in translational flight, including a flow component ($V$) due to this forward movement, which adds to the velocity due to rotation.
This results in a reverse flow region being formed
