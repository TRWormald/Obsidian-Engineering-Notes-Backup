There are two primary classes of rotorcraft:
1) Helicopters
In a helicopter the rotor is connected to an engine, which drives it and generates lift.
2) Autogyros
However in an autogyro the rotor is not connected to an engine and the rotorcraft has a separate propeller which pulls the aircraft forward, and forces air through the rotor to generate lift.

In the image below we can see the difference between these two:
