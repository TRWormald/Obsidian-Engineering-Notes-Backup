The vortex sheet is a line of infinitesimal vortices of strength:
$$d\Gamma=\gamma~ds$$
![[Pasted image 20250209221956.png|centre]]
Where $\gamma=\gamma(s)$ is the vortex strength per unit length along the sheet.

The induced (tangential) velocity at point $P$ due to an element of the vortex sheet is:
$$dV_{\theta}=-\frac{\gamma}{2\pi r}~ds$$
And the total circulation around finite length of the sheet is:
$$\Gamma=\int_{a}^{b}\gamma ~ds$$
The discontinuity in velocity across the sheet or the local jump in tangential velocity is equal to the local sheet strength:
$$\gamma=v_{t1}-v_{t2}$$
