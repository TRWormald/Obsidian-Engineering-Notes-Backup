Positive camber gives negative offset - i.e. the lift curve shifts upwards.

It is also interesting to note that $\alpha_{l=0}$ depends on $(\cos\theta -1)$ - i.e. it is most sensitive to $dz/dx$ at the trailing edge so changes in camber have the most effect when applied towards the TE. (hence why we use flaps)
