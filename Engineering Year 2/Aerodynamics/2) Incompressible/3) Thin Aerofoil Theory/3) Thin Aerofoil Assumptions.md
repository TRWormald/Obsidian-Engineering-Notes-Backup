**Assumption 1**
For a thin aerofoil the upper and lower surfaces become indistinguishable so we can use a single vortex sheet situated on the mean camber line:

This is still tricky to solve though.

**Assumption 2**
If the camber is small, we can move the vortex sheet to the chordline:

- A straight sheet simplifies derivation
- We still choose $\gamma(x)$ so that the mean camber line is a streamline

When making the mean camber line a streamline we need to work out:
- The component of the freestream velocity normal to the camber line
- The vortex sheet induced component to the camber line $w'(s)$

**Assumption 3**
As camber is small, the approximate vortex-induced velocity on the camber line, $w'(s)$, is equal to that induced on the chord line $w(x)$
