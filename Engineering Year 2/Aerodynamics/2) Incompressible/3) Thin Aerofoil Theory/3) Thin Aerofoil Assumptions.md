**Assumption 1**
For a thin aerofoil the upper and lower surfaces become indistinguishable so we can use a single vortex sheet situated on the mean camber line:

This is still tricky to solve though.

**Assumption 2**
If the camber is small, we can move the vortex sheet to the chordline:

- A straight sheet simplifies derivation
- We still choose $\gamma(x)$ so that the mean camber line is a streamline

When making the mean camber line a streamline we need to work out:
- The component of the freestream velocity normal to the camber line
- The vortex sheet induced component to the camber line $w'(s)$

**Assumption 3**
As camber is small, the approximate vortex-induced velocity on the camber line, $w'(s)$, is equal to that induced on the chord line $w(x)$:
$$w'(s)\approx w(x)$$

The [[3) The Kutta Condition|Kutta Condition]] implies that the upper and lower surface velocities are equal at the trailing-edge.
So:
$$\gamma(TE)=0$$
### Symmetric or Uncambered Aerofoils
For symmetric or uncambered aerofoils the derivation of the fundamental equations are simplified as the chord and camber line are identical.
In this case the assumptions (2) and (3) are unnecessary.
