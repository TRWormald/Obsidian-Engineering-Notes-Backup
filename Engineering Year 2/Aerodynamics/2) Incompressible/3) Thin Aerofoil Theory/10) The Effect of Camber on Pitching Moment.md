A similar analysis to before gives:
$$C_{M_{LE}}=- \frac{\pi}{2}\left(A_{0}+A_{1}- \frac{A_{2}}{2}\right)$$Or in terms of the lift coefficient:
$$C_{M_{LE}}=-\frac{C_{L}}{4}- \frac{\pi}{4}(A_{1}-A_{2})$$
i.e.
- Symmetric aerofoil behaviour plus a constant offset
- Offset is the "zero-lift pithing moment" $C_{M_{0}}$
$$C_{M_{0}}=- \frac{\pi}{4}(A_{1}-A_{2})$$
The two moment reference points are then:
$$\bar{x}_{cp}=- \frac{C_{M_{LE}}}{C_{L}}=0.25\left(1+ \frac{\pi}{C_{L}}(A_{1}-A_{2})\right)$$
Which shifts with alpha.
And:
$$\bar{x}_{ac}=-\frac{dC_{M_{LE}}}{dC_{L}}=0.25$$
Which is at the quarter chord.
