Lifting flows over a general aerofoil in a uniform stream can be modelled by placing vortex sheets on its surface:

The sheet strength $\gamma(s)$ is chosen so that the combined action of $\gamma(s)$ and the freestream velocity $V_{\infty}$ makes the surface a streamline.
These usually need to be solved numerically.
