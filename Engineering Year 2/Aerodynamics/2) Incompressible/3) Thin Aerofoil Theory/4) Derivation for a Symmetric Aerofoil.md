A vortex sheet is placed on the chord line and as this is also the camber line it must be made a streamline of the flow:

And with a symmetric aerofoil:
$$\frac{dz}{dx}=0$$
To make the chord line a streamline there must be no flow normal to it. So we need to find:
1) The component of the freestream velocity normal to the chordline:

2) The vortex induced velocity normal to the chordline $w(x)$
At a point $x$ on the chordline the vortex-induced velocity normal to the line is $w(x)$.
This is found by considering the velocity induced by a small element of the vortex sheet with strength $\gamma(\xi)d\xi$ located at distance $\xi$ from the origin on the chordline:

So using $v_{\theta}=-\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi r}$:
$$dw(x)=-\frac{}{}$$
