So far sources, sinks, or vortices have been added to a uniform flow and then any streamline of the resulting flow patter may be taken to represent a solid surface since no flow can cross it.
But this *direct* approach is very restrictive. A more general approach is needed that will allow the potential flow solution about arbitrary aerofoils to be calculated.
