The magnitude of circulation $\Gamma$ in our potential model of the lifting cylinder is arbitrary. 
Since solutions for an aerofoil shape can be found by conformal mapping from the circle there will similarly been an infinite number of valid potential models for flows past these aerofoils.
However in a real lifting flow over an aerofoil circulation and hence lift are not arbitrary.
The question then arises, how can the potential model be made to select the appropriate value for $\Gamma$?

Consider an aerofoil shape generated by transforming a circle. In particular look at trailing-edge potential flow for $\Gamma=0$, mathematical potential solution gives:

Where the aft stagnation point is on the upper surface, therefore the flow has to negotiate the sharp trailing-edge. The sharp corner implies infinite local velocity in theoretical potential flow, but this cannot happen in a real viscous flow.

>In a real flow the action of viscosity is such that the flow leave the T-E smoothly, and the velocity there is finite.

So the effect of viscosity can be modelled in an inviscid flow by adding just enough circulation so that the flow leaves the T-E smoothly. **This is the Kutta Condition.**

The empirical Kutta condition fixes the value of circulation at any angle of attack, and hence the lift via:
$$l=\rho U_\infty\Gamma$$
The implications of this are that the velocities and hence pressures top and bottom must be equal:
- For aerofoils with a finite T-E angle there must be a stagnation point at the trailing edge.
- For a cusped T-E aerofoil the velocities on the top and bottom surfaces must have the same magnitude and direction at the trailing edge.
