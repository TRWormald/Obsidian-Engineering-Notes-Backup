This transformation generates aerofoils with varying thickness and camber. It was the first series of theoretically designed aerofoil sections and with analytical potential solutions they were used to validate numerical methods.

The aerofoils produced aren't particularly good due to the cusped trailing edge, and circular arc camber-line.

The conformal transformation technique has the major disadvantage of being *inverse* i.e. the aerofoil shape is a product of the solution process. 
Hence the method cannot answer the question ‘what forces does this aerofoil/shape produce?’, for an arbitrary input aerofoil shape. 
It is also strictly limited to 2D problems, as conformal mappings do not exist in higher dimensions. 
However the Joukowski aerofoils do help to establish a very important condition needed to develop appropriate potential models for arbitrary aerofoils, namely the Kutta condition.
