Points in the $(x,y)$ plane can be thought of as geometrical representations of complex numbers: i.e. $Z=x+iy$. 
A conformal transformation uses a regular function $f$ to map every point in the $Z$ domain to a point in the (say) $\zeta(=\zeta+i\eta)$ domain, so that angles between curves are preserved.

Stream and potential functions can be combined to give a complex potential in the $Z$ domain $W(x+iy)=\phi+i\$
