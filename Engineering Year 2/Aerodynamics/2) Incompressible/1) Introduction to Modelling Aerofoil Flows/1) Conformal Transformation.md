The potential solutions considered so far have been for simple geometries. However the material can be extended to model the flow about more relevant geometries.
The baseline of this will be knowledge of conformal transformations:
### Conformal Transformation
Points in the $(x,y)$ plane can be thought of as geometrical representations of complex numbers: i.e. $Z=x+iy$. 
A conformal transformation uses a regular function $f$ to map every point in the $Z$ domain to a point in the (say) $\zeta(=\xi+i\eta)$ domain, so that angles between curves are preserved.

Stream and potential functions can be combined to give a complex potential in the $Z$ domain:
$$W(x+iy)=\phi+i\psi$$

In the image above we can see how the rotating cylinder and its potential functions have been transformed to the more complex aerofoil shape.

*Note that $W(\xi+i\eta)=W(x+iy)$ so potential and stream functions have the same values, velocities are different because they are found by differentiating with respect to the different coordinate directions:*
$$u-iv=\frac{dW}{dZ}$$
$$\nu_{\xi}-i\nu_{\eta}=\frac{dW}{d\zeta}$$
