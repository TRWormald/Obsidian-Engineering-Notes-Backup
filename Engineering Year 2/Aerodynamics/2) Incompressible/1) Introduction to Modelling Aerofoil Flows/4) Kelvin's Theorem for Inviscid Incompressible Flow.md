The Kutta condition states that the circulation about an aerofoil is the value required to make the trailing edge smoothly. We will now look at how this circulation is generated.

Kelvin's theorem is that:
*The time rate of change of circulation around a closed curve consisting of the same fluid elements is zero.*

i.e. there is ‘conservation of circulation’. 
This means that circulation (and hence lift) cannot be created in potential flow! 
In a real flow it is the action of viscosity that leads to the generation of circulation.
