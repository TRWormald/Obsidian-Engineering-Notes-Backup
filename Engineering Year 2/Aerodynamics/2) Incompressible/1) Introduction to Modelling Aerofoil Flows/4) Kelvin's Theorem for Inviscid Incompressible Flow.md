The Kutta condition states that the circulation about an aerofoil is the value required to make the trailing edge smoothly. We will now look at how this circulation is generated.

Kelvin's theorem is that:
*The time rate of change of circulation around a closed curve consisting of the same fluid elements is zero.*

i.e. there is ‘conservation of circulation’. 
This means that circulation (and hence lift) cannot be created in potential flow! 
In a real flow it is the action of viscosity that leads to the generation of circulation.
### The Starting Vortex
Consider an aerofoil that is initially at rest in a stationary fluid, then the effects of viscosity are negligible. The circulation about the aerofoil (which equals the line integral of velocity around any curve enclosing the aerofoil) is zero:![[Pasted image 20250119153936.png|center]]
When the aerofoil is impulsively set in motion, the circulation and lift are not produced instantaneously. At the instant of  starting the circulation is zero and the rear stagnation point is on the upper surface of the aerofoil and the fluid has to negotiate a sharp trailing edge:

In the real flow viscosity acts to damp the large velocity gradients produced and a region of high vorticity forms at the trailing edge. 
This is shed downstream as the stagnation point moves aft and is accompanied by a progressive increase in circulation and lift around the aerofoil until the **Kutta Condition** is satisfied.

The shed vorticity rolls up into point vortex of strength -$\Gamma$ which convects downstream:

Kelvin's theorem tells us that since the total circulation about the curve consisting of the same fluid elements remains zero if it is far enough out so that the flow remains inviscid and irrotational, so a circulation of +$\Gamma$ must develop about the aerofoil.
When shed the vortex is far enough downstream its effect on the aerofoil can be ignored and it doesn't need to be included in the model.

**Note that:**
Whenever there is a change in aerofoil lift, the local velocity at the Trailing-Edge changes and causes a vortex to be shed into the flow of opposite strength to the increase in wing circulation:

Overall circulation remains constant, but the shed starting vortex convects downstream.
