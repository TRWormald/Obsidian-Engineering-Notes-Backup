Circulation is the integral of the velocity component along a closed contour $C$:

If the vorticity is zero everywhere ([[Engineering Year 1/AVDASI/Aerodynamics/Potential Flow/Irrotational Flow]]) within the closed contour, then the circulation $\Gamma=0$.
\
The circulation is equal to the total vortex strength:
