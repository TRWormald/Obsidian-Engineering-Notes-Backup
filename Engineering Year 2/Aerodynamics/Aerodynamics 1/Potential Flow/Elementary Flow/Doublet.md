A Doublet is an example of Elementary Flow which is comprised of a Source and a Sink with a very small distance between them.
The following diagram shows a doublet:

\
Where:
$\kappa = \Lambda l$ with $\Lambda$ being equal to the strength of the source and sink and $l$ being the distance between them.
\
Note: The doublet has a direction, or axis, associated with it. The positive direction is given by an arrow drawn from the sink to the source:
