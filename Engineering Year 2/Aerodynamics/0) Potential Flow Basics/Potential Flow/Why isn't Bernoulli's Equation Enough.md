Consider applying [[Bernoulli's Equation]] along each streamline for steady inviscid incompressible flow.
Even if we know the initial pressure and velocity along each streamline, [[Bernoulli's Equation]] does not give us the streamline position so that we can integrate along it.
If we make the further assumption of irrotational flow then we still need the pressure throughout the domain to give us the velocity field, or the velocity field to give us the pressure distribution.
\
-> Pressure at any point can be calculated only if the velocity is known at that point and pressure & velocity are known at an arbitrary point.
