The following steps should be followed to solve Potential Flows:

1) Solve [[Engineering Year 2/Aerodynamics/0) Potential Flow Basics/Potential Flow/Laplace's Equation]] to find the potential in the domain
2) Differentiate to find the velocity at all points
3) Use [[Bernoulli's Equation]] to find the pressure at all points given the pressure and velocity at a single point (far field conditions)
