By making several assumptions we can derive [[Bernoulli's Equation]] from the Navier-Stokes Equations. Those assumptions are:

1) Viscous effects are negligible
2) Steady flow
3) No Body Forces (like gravity)
4) The flow is along a [[Streamline]]
6) There is [[Engineering Year 2/Aerodynamics/0) Potential Flow Basics/Potential Flow/Irrotational Flow]]
7) The flow is Incompressible
8) The flow is [[Adiabatic]]
\
This gives us:
\
$$ p+\frac{1}{2}\rho V^2 = constant$$
\
Which is [[Bernoulli's Equation]] without the hydrostatic component (as we have ignored body forces)
And is valid for:
i) Any two points along a streamline
ii) Any two points anywhere in an irrotational flow
