What is the simplest way to express an aircraft's performance?
We can consider the forces acting on the aircraft (lift & weight, thrust & drag) and therefore the amounts required:

Weight => Lift => Drag => Thrust => Fuel Consumption => Weight

Each drives the other in turn, for a given set of operating conditions.

Therefore the data we need for an aircraft performance calculation is:
1) The mission definition (Operating conditions, range, take off and landing requirements)
2) Mass (Payload, fuel load, operator's mass empty, maximum take off mass)
3) Drag Data (Zero lift, Induced, Wave, Reynolds Drag)
4) Engine Data (Thrust, and fuel flow across the flight envelope)
